         Jamie built an electromagnet that could fit inside a wristwatch and mounted it near a target. They then fired bullets at the target, making sure that the bullets passed close by the electromagnet. However, the wristwatch sized electromagnet was not powerful enough to change the bullet's trajectory. The MythBusters then upgraded to a larger and more powerful electromagnet, but it still could not deflect the bullet. Finally, the MythBusters resorted to using a series of thirteen super powerful permanent
         <a href="/wiki/Rare-earth_magnet" title="Rare-earth magnet">
          rare-earth magnets
         </a>
         , which only deflected the bullet enough to bounce off the magnets before hitting the target. The MythBusters explained that a magnet's energy decreased "exponentially" the farther away someone is from the magnet (the force actually follows an inverse square law). Plus, in order to be powerful enough to stop a bullet, an electromagnet would need an enormous amount of energy that could not possibly be contained within a wristwatch, which would make most of the magnet scenes in Bond films impossible (with the possible exception of the unzipping scene).

         First, the Build Team decided to test whether it was possible to breach a propane tank with Bond's 9 mm handgun. They found that 9 mm rounds were not powerful enough to breach the tank, but shotgun shells and 7.62 NATO caliber rifle rounds were more than enough to pierce the tank. They then fired armor-piercing rifle rounds at a tank filled with propane, but could not get the tank to explode. Not even tracer rounds were successful.

         The MythBusters obtained a boat which was identical to the model Bond used in the movie. They then converted it so that it could be remote controlled and built a makeshift ramp in

          Lake Yosemite

         . They even put a barge with a car under the ramp to simulate the exact scene from the movie. Adam drove the boat at the ramp at a speed of 45 miles per hour (72 km/h), but lost control of the boat at the last second and hit the ramp at an angle. As a result, the boat managed to clear the car, but flipped in the process. However, seeing that there was no visible damage to the boat, the MythBusters decided that the myth was plausible. It was also pointed out that the stunt team in
         <i>

         crashed 17 boats and made about a hundred practice runs just to perfect the jump.

They then used 200 pounds (91 kg) of TNT and a mechanical surfer (built by Grant) to see if it's possible to generate a wave large enough to surf. Even with two hundred pounds of high explosives, the wave was not large enough for surfing. In addition, the consultant (Dr. Van Romero) stated that an explosion of that magnitude would likely cause death by internal bleeding within 24 hours if someone was submerged in the water at the time.

         The MythBusters first performed a small scale test with a model airplane and a small conveyor belt and were not able to get the model plane to take off from the belt, it merely fell off the front of the conveyor belt. They then tested a model remote-controlled plane on a moving length of paper. The plane moved forward from its starting position and took off. Finally they upgraded to full scale using an actual manned plane and a runway-sized tarp as a makeshift conveyor belt. Like the small scale test, the plane moved forward from its starting position and was able to take off from the conveyor belt. The MythBusters explained that this was possible because unlike cars, an airplane's means of propulsion is through its propeller or jet engine, not its wheels; a car's engine mechanically moves its wheels, which use their contact with the road and the traction it provides to generate forward movement, while the plane's wheels are free-moving and independent of the propeller, which uses air displacement for forward thrust. Therefore, the conveyor belt has no bearing on the forward momentum of the plane.

         The Build Team obtained some shaving cream, froze it, and then placed the contents into a car, but the results were disappointing as the shaving cream did not expand very much. They then put over fifty cans of frozen shaving cream inside, but that strategy failed to produce any results as well. Finally, the Build Team decided to fill the car with industrial strength foam, which would expand much more than shaving cream. The industrial strength foam expanded significantly and was able to fill the entire car. However, the myth was busted since the subject of the myth was shaving cream, which does not expand very much.

         On physical inspection, the shaken martini is cloudier because of the ice that was crushed because of the shaking, compared to stirred one, which is clear. But when the ice in the shaken martini melts, it is similar to the stirred martini. In a blind taste test wherein only Tory knew the clear shaken martinis and the stirred ones, Kari, Grant and the expert hired for the myth (Anthony Dias Blue, who previously appeared in "Vodka Myths III") were able to correctly distinguish the shaken ones. Several explanations on why this is so were also given.

         There was no myth to test here; the task was to find if arrowheads were overall more effective than sharpened sticks. Adam and Jamie created sharpened sticks and arrowheads from scratch, noting that it took much longer to make the arrowheads. When shot into ballistics gel, the arrowheads went in farther than the sticks. After putting some fur over the gel, the results were the same, and it was noted that the arrowheads made bigger wounds in the target, which would mean faster bleeding to death for the animal. Adam pointed out that arrowheads would have been akin to caveman technology, and would be widely used. Jamie also pointed out that sharpened wooden sticks would have rotted away after so long and therefore would have not been found.

         Adam and Jamie put black eye paint under their eyes and took an eye exam, then repeated with lighter, peach colored eye paint. Their scores were the same each time. Adam then set up a light meter in a dummy's eye and recorded the

         reading in the eye with and without the paint, but the results were not very different. Adam then put a baseball cap on the dummy and repeated it again, and noticed that with the black eye paint on, the lux reading significantly dropped. The theory behind this is that, while the cap is able to block most of the direct light, there's still plenty of light being reflected off of one's cheeks and into the eye; the eye black could be meant to reduce this reflected light.

         The build team went to a circus training centre and tried to slide down a wire similar to the ones used in ski lifts while hanging onto jeans. Tory barely moved, and the jeans were more likely to rip apart. After lubricating the wire, though, it became a little easier. Once the build team tried it on a real ski lift, however, the friction was too great, the jeans kept bunching up, and Tory was not able to move easily. Buster had no momentum at all, and the jeans eventually ripped.

         Adam and Jamie set up a trail of black powder which burned down the line as predicted. They set up another trail from a funnel and kept the leaking funnel at the end, and the ignited trail carried up into the funnel. Later, a robot carrying a leaking barrel was set up and started to move. But when the ignited trail reached the robot, it did not follow up the falling powder and into the barrel. It was only when they increased the size of the hole and had the barrel shaking that the ignition followed into the barrel.

         When the unlocker was activated near the cell phone, the car door did not open on the other end. In addition, Grant explained that car unlockers and cell phones operate on completely different frequencies. A cell phone deals with frequency within the range of human speech, which is less than 10 kHz. So due to bandwidth restrictions, it would therefore be impossible to recreate the signal of the unlocker.

         The MythBusters placed sodium in a gel capsule, placed it in a bottle full of warm water, placed the bottle against a cinder block wall, and packed it in with sand. However, one gram of sodium was not powerful enough to damage the wall (or even the bottle it was in), and 100 grams of sodium was also not enough. The MythBusters then used 500 grams of more-reactive potassium placed inside a cannon-like contraption to direct all the force onto the wall, but still failed to cause any damage. The MythBusters finally resorted to using C4 high explosive to demolish the wall.

         , duct tape, trash bags, and a cement mixer engine. The show depicted the plane MacGyver built as not being powerful enough to achieve flight on its own, but was able to attain enough lift to sustain powered flight after taxiing off a cliff. With their plane complete, the Build Team added remote controls and took the plane to a quarry that had flat, level ground and a 150-foot (46 m) cliff. While they demonstrated that the plane's engine had enough power to move the plane, it was not enough to achieve flight and the plane plummeted straight to the ground.

         To test this myth, Adam and Jamie went to Fischer Pond in Alaska. The dog consistently retrieved and brought back the object thrown onto the frozen lake, at about the same speed each time. However, under the SUV, the dynamite did next to nothing. It took 24 pounds (11 kg) of dynamite (packed into high-density directional cones) to blow a hole large enough to sink the SUV. Jamie noted that in order for a single stick of dynamite to break the ice, it would have to be so thin that the SUV (and probably even a human) would cause the ice to break under its weight. This myth had formed part of the plot of the 2006 movie

         To test this myth, Adam and Jamie were locked inside separate cabins in Alaska, with no entertainment at all. Both regularly took cognitive tests (to measure mental capacity) and saliva tests (to measure stress). However, the results of the cognitive tests were too consistent, and the saliva tests were rendered worthless by the fact that Adam and Jamie frequently sullied them by eating and drinking beforehand. However, Adam exhibited all four common symptoms of cabin fever (irritability, forgetfulness, restlessness, and excessive sleeping) and Jamie exhibited one (excessive sleeping).

         To test this belief, the Build Team first created a rubber model of a moose with similar weight and consistency after direct study of actual animals. They then ran similar passenger cars into the moose at different speeds and found that while greater speeds did make the moose hit higher, it still did not clear the car and still caused extreme amounts of damage. They repeated the test with a low sports car at the highest test track speed to give the moose the best chance of clearing the roof, but again it was not enough and the moose damaged the car enough that any driver would have been seriously injured. The Build Team surmised that for the moose to actually clear a car would require a vehicle as low as a

They put Bruce in the water, and Tory and Adam in its mouth. When tested, they found that some positions of the body make it harder to hit the eyes. Lying face up took the smallest amount of time, while lying face down—like someone would on a surf board—was much harder.

For the retest, they used plastic fish cut-outs shielded by screens, so that only the flapping would be available to the sharks. There was some increase in shark activity towards the flapping fish, but not enough to be especially appreciable until the screen was removed and the sharks could see the fish. In the end, Adam and Jamie both agree that, while the sound of the fish flapping can very well get the sharks' interests up initially, it is not enough to hold that interest without additional stimuli.

         Adam and Jamie first placed tough cuts of steak in three explosive rigs (the first with a large high explosive, the second with a small black powder explosive, the third with a medium high-explosive charge in a suspended vessel with a heavy steel plate). In all rigs the steaks and explosives were placed in water to equalize the concussive force. The steaks were cooked and compared to two controls, an untouched steak and a steak with powdered meat tenderizer. The steaks were put in a blind taste test, but the judges (i. e. Adam, Jamie, and
         <a href="/wiki/Ron_Siegel" title="Ron Siegel">
          Ron Siegel
         </a>
         ) were inconsistent in determining what steak was most tender. The MythBusters then tried to tenderize steaks by shooting them out of an air cannon into a steel target or placing them with large ball bearings into a clothes dryer. The meat was then tested using a device similar to
         <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">
          USDA

         machines for determining meat toughness. The machine proved to be an objective and consistent method for testing, and both methods for pulverizing the steaks were shown to be successful. Adam and Jamie then retried all the explosive rigs and tested the meat with the device. The exploded meat was far more tender than the control.

Before the first test, they were both given stimulus designed to relax them, including massage, contact with puppies, and seeing favorite movies. Before the second, they were given stimulus designed to aggravate them, including large amounts of caffeine, denial of bathroom facilities, getting a more painful massage, Grant's feet being put in water with fish, and a false revelation that they were given laxatives. Both drivers used about a third more fuel in the second run than the first—Tory used more fuel even though he took the wrong path and completed only two-thirds of the required course distance.

         into the vacuum chamber. They manipulated the flag in a manner similar to what the astronauts did when they planted the flag on the Moon, then stopped the manipulation. They first tested at normal pressure; the momentum moved the flag around somewhat but quickly dissipated. In pure vacuum conditions, after the manipulation stopped, the

          momentum

         The Build Team first tested whether dry or wet sand made a more distinguishable footprint by stepping in them with an astronaut boot. It was clear that the wet footprint had more detail than the dry footprint. They then placed sand similar in composition to the soil on the Moon in a vacuum chamber and stepped on it with an astronaut boot, which made a clear print. The reason for this is that the composition of lunar soil differs from terrestrial sand, meaning it behaves differently when stepped on. Terrestrial soil is weathered and rounded, so the particles do not support each other's weight very well. Lunar soil, because it is not weathered, has a more jagged texture, so the particles "lock" with each other and will hold the shape of the imprint much more clearly.

         The MythBusters first created a small scale experiment using a model car and a set of garden hoses connected to a single fire hose. The small scale model worked perfectly, proving that the basic idea was at least possible. Before the full-scale test, the duo decide to find out the pounds of thrust by using a machine, however the water pressure destroyed the machine. But during the full scale experiment, the MythBusters could not get the car to levitate. Part of the problem was because the necessary pressure to lift the weight of the car was beyond the water pressure the city's system could provide. They then got the idea to take out the car's engine block, deducing that the people who performed the stunt in the viral video may have done the same thing. Once the engine was removed, the car then levitated a full 15 feet (4.6 m) in the air for 45 seconds.

While none of the attempts by the hosts to intentionally startle goats succeeded, the show's crew frequently caused goats to faint by accident while filming. The attending goat handler explained that some goats, when startled or scared, involuntarily stiffen their leg muscles which can cause them to fall over and give the appearance of fainting. Tory and Kari warned that results are subjective depending on the goats, but the myth is still very true.

         Grant tested this myth according to the process shown in the video, but was unable to get the iPod to charge. In order to confirm whether or not any charge was moving across the onion, Grant plugged a voltmeter into the onion, which indicated that there was zero charge in the onion. Grant explained that the basic idea would be that the electrolytes could be used as a sort of "wet battery", but the setup in the video lacked the vital anode and cathode, which would actually move the electrolytes. With this evidence, Grant declared the video a hoax.

         The MythBusters tried to pull the books apart with human power, first attempting to do so on their own and then bringing in ten other people (which included Tory and Kari in a separate test) to help. These attempts did not succeed, so they hooked up a pair of cars to try to pull the phone books apart. However, the books held and the MythBusters resorted to using the

While the myth was busted, the MythBusters pointed out that it took 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg, or about 36,000 N) of force to part the phone books; the two cars they used in the testing could have been suspended from ropes connected to the two interleaved books without separating them.

         The Build Team first tested this myth using a canister with the same dimensions as in the movie, which could only hold 28 grams of powder, which did not even disturb the surface of the water, and caused minimal damage to Hugo. Two and a half sticks of dynamite (681 grams of powder), was enough to blow up Hugo and cause a large explosion, but not anywhere near as large as seen in the movie. The Build Team also concluded that the size of the canister needed to contain two and a half sticks of dynamite would make the harpoon too heavy to hit a target 100 feet (30 m) away. Eventually, to produce an explosion of the movie's magnitude, 400 pounds (180 kg) of TNT was used.

         ). However, most of the commercial water guns they tested could not shoot a continuous stream of water long enough to carry the current. They then tested the amount of electricity a stream of water could deliver to a target, but discovered the voltage dropped significantly the farther away the target was, ultimately failing at any distance over a few feet, making it impractical to use at long distances and busting the myth. In order to see what it would take to have a water stun gun work at a distance, the MythBusters used a
         <a href="/wiki/Tesla_coil" title="Tesla coil">
          tesla coil
         </a>
         to power the gun with up to a million volts. The gun worked at a distance, and the lightning bolt could clearly be seen traveling down the stream of water. However, the rig remained impractical due to its sheer size and the amount of electricity required to operate it.

         The Build Team first tested how much heat could be transferred into a bare foot by walking over coals with heat-resistant silicone. They then theorized that feet do not get burned due to three factors: the foot does not stay in contact with the coals long enough to get burned, and both the coals and the resulting ash form an insulating layer to lock in the majority of the heat. They then tried coal walking, and easily crossed them. The team noted that they felt confident because of their faith in physics. For a more complete result, the Build Team had Adam, who was not aware of the physics involved, cross the coals. When Adam tried, he had his feet burned, though this was attributed to Adam using the incorrect technique. Adam walked too fast and had hot coals stuck under his toes, meaning they stayed in contact with his skin longer than normal.

         Adam and Jamie first tried driving while blindfolded but failed miserably. They got a real blind person (Jerry Kuns) behind the wheel within the same abandoned subdivision as the "Don't Drive Angry" myth (though differently routed and with a driveway parking component rather than
         <a href="/wiki/Parallel_parking" title="Parallel parking">

         on the street) and he did fairly well. But when the instructor (Jamie) was intoxicated, and unable to communicate properly the test did not go as well. If the passenger was drunk, the communications broke down, preventing the blind driver from getting clear, precise, and timely instructions. Adam and Jamie also emphasized that this sort of driving is illegal: if the passenger is rendered incapacitated the blind person would have no way of knowing what was on the road and how to respond, obviously increasing the risk of an accident. Furthermore, a person rendered blind before they could get a driver's license would have no preconceptions of how to drive, making following instructions easier than if they had previous driving experience. They reasoned that this is because a person with experience wants to do what he thinks should be done, while a person with no experience would rely solely on the instructor.

For a second test, the dummy wearing the metal cleats was then dressed further with clothing, a necklace, and a metal-laden belt to increase the likelihood of being struck, but the plastic one was also struck during the test, although less often (8 times for the metal cleats vs. 2). As a finale, they demonstrated the danger of holding up a golf club during a thunderstorm. Lightning struck the club and went through the dummy, melting him.

       This myth was revisited due to fan complaints that the bow was too close to the arrow catching rig, so the arrow was traveling faster than it would at a farther distance. Fans also pointed out many people who could catch an arrow on camera and wanted the MythBusters to bring one on the show.

         The MythBusters first tested the speed of an arrow and showed that an arrow maintains its speed as far as 70 feet (21 m) because of its aerodynamic design. They then brought "The Arrowcatcher"

         onto the show and had him perform various tests. Anthony proved that he could catch tennis balls traveling at 85 miles per hour (137 km/h) (breaking a world record in the process). They then had him try and catch an actual arrow, and Anthony succeeded in catching an arrow. However, at Anthony's request, the arrow had been fired below full strength (3/4 strength) and directly in front of Anthony. The MythBusters decided to redo the test by firing arrows at full strength from multiple directions. This time, Anthony had much more trouble and could only catch the arrows when he knew which direction they were coming from. Since Anthony was unable to catch the arrow in full combat conditions, the MythBusters considered the myth busted.

The one inch punch had half the force of Jamie's punch, and the three inch punch had two thirds the force. Anthony further demonstrated the power of the punch by using it to break only the last of three wooden boards, a feat that Jamie was unable to match. The MythBusters concluded that with the right training, a person can use the one inch punch with enough power and expertise to knock out a person.

         To maximize objectivity, the MythBusters decided to look at a number of sample photos and rate them while sober and again while drunk. Adam started first by rating 30 women and gave a rating of 96 out of a total of 300. Kari's rated photos of 30 men and had a total score of 154. Finally, Jamie had a score of 116. While buzzed (only drinking a few beers), Adam had a score of 121, Kari had 89, and Jamie had 105. While completely drunk, Adam had a score of 134, Kari had 153, and Jamie had 111. In conclusion, even though they had different results, the MythBusters decided the myth was plausible since their overall scores increased when they got completely drunk.

       Adam and Jamie tested several alleged methods for sobering up quickly. For each test, one of the co-hosts subjected himself to the remedy while the other did not, and both then traced a line pattern as quickly and accurately as possible. The difference in their performances was taken as the effectiveness of the remedy, although Adam also mentioned at the end of the experiment that their

         For the first stage, the Build Team tested whether an ancient rocket-powered arrow could travel 500 yards. They found an arrow could travel that far if enough powder is used. In the second stage, they tested whether an ancient arrow could be rigged to lethally explode. They found if packed right, an exploding arrow could inflict a mortal wound. They then moved to the third stage, where they actually built a hwacha to test if it could fire 200 arrows. During the test, the hwacha performed almost perfectly, firing 199 of the 200 arrows which all landed near the target army. With such conclusive results as well as historical record on their side, the Build Team declared the myth confirmed.

         The MythBusters first obtained a bike similar to the type used during filming. They then built a mechanized rig that could fire a pole at the same speed a human can throw one. They found that it was possible for a human to throw a pole into the wheel and cause it to stop. They then attempted the full-scale test with a moving bike. At a speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h), the bike snapped the wooden pole without stopping. They then decided to redo the test, except with a steel pole. While the steel pole did stop the bike, it skidded instead of flipping, definitively busting the myth. The team analyzed the movie scene and discovered that explosives were used to flip the bike. They then built a mortar and used it to flip the bike in an elaborate recreation of the movie scene.

After 600 punches the robot had created a crack in the lid, but had not punched a hole in it. Then the team placed six feet of dirt on the coffin, and again the robot only split the lid and could not create a hole. To test what would happen if a hole could be made, the Build Team built an acrylic coffin outfitted with a trapdoor and a sliding panel to let dirt in. First Tory entered the coffin and 2 feet (61 cm) of dirt were placed on him. He was able to dig himself out. When Grant repeated this experiment with 6 feet of dirt, the dirt entered the coffin so fast and filled it so completely that there was no way anyone could escape. Based on these results, the myth was declared busted.

         The Build Team opted to apply this myth to running, then to riding a bicycle, and finally to driving a small car. For running, Kari, Tory, and Grant each ran a distance of 30 feet (9.1 m), first from a standstill, then dropping from a trapeze bar while running in air, and finally riding a zipline to the starting line while running in air. Dropping from the trapeze bar was barely faster than starting from a standstill, while riding the zipline was slower. For the bicycle, Tory made a rig that allowed him to drop the rear wheel while spinning onto the ground. This made the bike unstable, and was slower than a dead start. Finally, Kari drove a car 300 feet (91 m) from a standstill, and then the team raised the front wheels off the ground while Kari revved the engine before dropping. Once again, the car was faster when driving from a dead start. Declaring the myth busted, the Build Team theorized that traction was key; unlike with a dead start, where the runner already has traction to build up and maintain speed, hitting the ground running is the opposite, trying to gain traction while at speed, and that few moments needed to gain traction slows the runner down enough to not be faster than if the runner started from a dead start.

         Adam and Jamie first visited the zoo to obtain a variety of feces to try to polish. Poop collected, they tried to pick the most polishable candidates, and then baked them to remove the moisture. Adam tried to shine his poop with a buffing wheel, while Jamie's tactic of applying a furniture polish caused a philosophical disagreement between the two. Adam eventually brought in an outside expert to teach them

Applying this technique, Adam and Jamie were both able to polish balls of poop without using any foreign materials as judged by a gloss meter, exceeding a standard of 70 gloss units for high gloss.

         To test this myth, Adam and Jamie tried different ways of ending the episode; first with a bang, and secondly with a slow burn. For the bang,

         was wrapped around Jamie's moped, and Adam added bottles of gasoline. The explosion utterly destroyed the moped. For a burn, Jamie mixed over 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of
         <a href="/wiki/Thermite" title="Thermite">
          thermite
         </a>
         , intending to use it to cut an SUV in half. While the SUV was not completely severed, the thermite burned through most of the vehicle, and both Adam and Jamie enjoyed the destruction. Adam preferred the bang more, but Jamie liked the burn. They decided to put the verdict of the myth to the fans on their website for voting. As of June 2009 more fans liked Adam's bang (59.8%) than Jamie's burn (40.2%).

         Because the experiment would last several days and be exposed to the sun, Adam and Jamie decided they did not want to use an animal carcass. First they got some meat and used a force gauge to determine how much pressure was needed to puncture the skin. They discovered that it took the same amount of force to pierce a torso made out of
         <a href="/wiki/Ballistic_gelatin" title="Ballistic gelatin">
          ballistic gelatin
         </a>
         . They then obtained some bamboo shoots, placed them in a greenhouse they constructed on the M5 roof and then placed the gel torso over the bamboo. After only three days, a couple of bamboo shoots had pierced the torso's back. However, Adam was disappointed the bamboo did not make it all the way through the torso. It appeared the sun may have melted the gel, so they got a mannequin torso and filled it with gel and only cut some small holes in the front and back for the bamboo to move. This time the bamboo grew right through the torso and rose to a height of about ten feet. Both Adam and Jamie agreed this would be extremely painful for a person to endure and declared the myth "plausible."

         To test this myth, Adam and Jamie swallowed internal thermometers which contained tiny transmitters that sent their core body temperature to a digital display. They then used a
         <a href="/wiki/Thermographic_camera" title="Thermographic camera">
          thermographic camera
         </a>
         to record the temperature of each other's face and hands. After recording their temperatures at M5, they went to a frozen food warehouse and sat in a room kept at 0 °F (−18 °C). Not long after sitting in the room, they started feeling the heat leave their extremities and measured their temperatures again. They discovered that while their faces and hands were indeed much colder, their core body temperatures were actually higher than when they were outside the freezer. They then called in Bob, a St. Bernard carrying a cask of brandy. Adam and Jamie drank the brandy and measured their temperatures again. They discovered their face and hands were warmer but their core body temperatures were dropping fast. Adam and Jamie declared the myth busted for this reason. They did, however, find some positive aspects to having a St. Bernard bring them brandy: The alcohol caused their blood vessels to widen, resulting in more blood going to the extremities. This made it less likely they would get frostbite. They also discovered they felt a lot better after drinking. Jamie also reported he felt warmer while snuggling with Bob. They concluded that if rescue was imminent, it would be a good idea to drink the brandy, but if rescue was uncertain, it would be a bad idea to drink alcohol because it would make a person die more quickly. The MythBusters also pointed out that the idea of St. Bernards roaming the mountains with casks of brandy around their necks is in itself a myth.

         Back at the bomb range, Tory, Grant and Kari placed some firewood under a grand piano and set it on fire. Instead of exploding, the piano slowly burned. The MythBusters found that the piano's disintegration did not cause the strings to pop; instead the frame and strings expanded from the heat, which slowly released the stored energy over a long period of time rather than all at once in a sudden explosion.
