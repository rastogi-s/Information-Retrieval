ngstrm wikipedia ngstrm for other uses see ngstrm disambiguation the ngstrm s t r m s t r m 1 2 ang strm ang strum swedish strm 1 or angstrom is a unit of length equal to 6990100000000000000 10 10 m one ten-billionth of a metre or 0.1 nanometre its symbol is a letter in the swedish alphabet the natural sciences and technology often use ngstrm to express sizes of atoms molecules microscopic biological structures and lengths of chemical bonds arrangement of atoms in crystals wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and dimensions of integrated circuit parts atoms of phosphorus sulfur and chlorine are about an ngstrm in covalent radius while a hydrogen atom is about half an ngstrm see atomic radius visible light has wavelengths in the range of 40007000 the unit is named after the swedish physicist anders jonas ngstrm 18141874 the symbol is always written with a ring diacritic as the letter in the swedish alphabet the units name is often written in english without the diacritics 3 but the official definitions do contain them 4 5 it is not a part of the si system of units use edit the ngstrm is used extensively in crystallography solid-state physics and chemistry as a unit for d-spacings the distance between atomic planes in a crystal 6 cell parameters inter-atomic distances and x-ray wavelengths as these values are often in the 110 range for example the inorganic crystal structure database 7 presents all these values using the ngstrm history edit anders jonas ngstrm was a pioneer in the field of spectroscopy and he is also well known for his studies of astrophysics heat transfer terrestrial magnetism and the aurora borealis in 1852 ngstrm formulated in optiska underskningar 8 in english translation optical researches 9 a law of absorption later modified somewhat and known as kirchhoffs law of thermal radiation in 1868 ngstrm created a chart of the spectrum of sunlight in which he expressed the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 6990100000000000000 10 7 mm 10 because the human eye is sensitive to wavelengths from about 7003400000000000000 4000 to 7003700000000000000 7000 visible light that choice of unit supported sufficiently accurate measurements of visible wavelengths without resorting to fractional numbers citation needed ngstrms chart and table of wavelengths in the solar spectrum became widely used in solar physics which adopted the unit and named it after him it subsequently spread to the rest of astronomical spectroscopy atomic spectroscopy and subsequently to other sciences that deal with atomic-scale structures though intended to correspond to 6990100000000000000 10 10 metres for precise spectral analysis the ngstrm had to be defined more accurately than the metre which until 1960 was still defined based on the length of a bar of metal held in paris the use of metal bars had been involved in an early error in the value of the ngstrm of about one part in 6000 ngstrm took the precaution of having the standard bar he used checked against a standard in paris but the metrologist henri tresca reported it to be so much shorter than it really was that ngstrms corrected results were more in error than the uncorrected ones 11 in 1907 the international astronomical union defined the international ngstrm by declaring the wavelength of the red line of cadmium in air equal to 6438.46963 international ngstrms and this definition was endorsed by the international bureau of weights and measures in 1927 12 from 1927 to 1960 the ngstrm remained a secondary unit of length for use in spectroscopy defined separately from the metre in 1960 the metre itself was redefined in spectroscopic terms which allowed the ngstrm to be redefined as being exactly 01nanometres the ngstrm is internationally recognized but is not a formal part of the international system of units si the closest si unit is the nanometre 6991100000000000000 10 9 m the international committee for weights and measures officially discourages its use and it is not included in the european unions catalogue of units of measure that may be used within its internal market 13 symbol edit for compatibility reasons unicode includes the formal symbol at u212b angstrom sign html 8491 however the ngstrm sign is also normalized into u00c5 latin capital letter a with ring above html 197 aring 14 the unicode consortium recommends to use the regular letter 00c5 before digital typesetting the ngstrm or ngstrm unit was sometimes written as au also an abbreviation of the astronomical unit this use is evident in braggs paper on the structure of ice 15 which gives the c and a-axis lattice constants as 4.52 au and 7.34 au respectively
