maurice allais wikipedia maurice allais maurice flix charles allais 2 31 may 1911 9 october 2010 was a french physicist and economist the 1988 winner of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources these pairs clarification needed considered that maurice allais could have been recognized along with john hicks value and capital 1939 and paul samuelson the foundations of economic analysis 1947 as the principal architect of the neoclassical synthesis they formalize the self-regulation of markets that keynes refuted while reiterating some of his ideas born in paris france allais attended the lyce lakanal graduated from the cole polytechnique in paris and studied at the cole nationale suprieure des mines de paris his academic and other posts have included being professor of economics at the cole nationale suprieure des mines de paris since 1944 and director of its economic analysis centre since 1946 in 1949 he received the title of doctor-engineer from the university of paris faculty of science he also held teaching positions at various institutions including at the university of paris x nanterre his first works oriented him towards the sciences of the concrete and the experiments of fundamental physics on which he will also publish numerous works notably on pendular oscillations and the laws of gravitation its after a trip in 1933 to the united states during the great depression that he decides to make the economy 3 allais died at his home in saint-cloud near paris at the age of 99 4 he considered as his principal inspirers leon walras wilfredo pareto and irving fisher he was reluctant to write in or translate his work into english and many of his major contributions became known to the dominant community only when they were independently rediscovered or popularized by english-speaking economists at the same time he claimed keyness liberalism and declared himself in favor of an important public sector allais attended the inaugural meeting of the mont pelerin society but he was alone among the attendees to refuse to sign the statement of aims because of a disagreement over the extent of property rights he exerted an important influence at the end of the war on french economists such as grard debreu edmond malinvaud and marcel boiteux paul samuelson 5 said had allais earliest writings been in english a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course and the nobel prize should have been awarded to him much earlier assar lindbeck the chairman of the selection committee considered allais as a giant within the world of economic analysis 6 contribution as an economist edit author of several theoretical and applied economics studies 7 his work has focused on the development of mathematical economics especially in the fields of general equilibrium theory capital theory decision theory and monetary policy a pioneer in macroeconomic monetary analyses the economist has been authoritative for his theoretical studies of risk illustrated by his famous paradox the less the risk is the more speculators flee he has also been a pioneer in various fields such as the role of central banks and the pricing of public services inspired at first by walras edit his first book develops the microeconomic aspect with trait dconomie pure which he wrote between january 1941 and july 1943 these pairs considered that maurice allais could have been recognized along with hicks and samuelson as the principal architect of the neoclassical synthesis he anticipates several of the propositions and theorems put forward by hicks samuelson and others sometimes giving them a more general and rigorous formulation in particular he demonstrates the equivalence theorems that kenneth arrow and gerard debreu will find in 1954 every equilibrium situation in a market economy is a situation of maximum efficiency and reciprocally every situation of maximum efficiency is a equilibrium situation in a market economy the market thus ensures economic efficiency and optimal distribution of income in the nation at the same time samuelson exposed the process of trial and error which leads to the equilibrium of markets in 1947 in the second part of his work conomie et intrt allais introduced time and currency and thus tackled the dynamics and growth of capitalist economies again he made several proposals whose discovery will be later attributed to other economists he introduced the first overlapping generations model olg model later popularized and attributed to paul samuelson in 1958 introduced the golden rule of optimal growth before trevor swan and edmund phelps show that an interest rate equal to the growth rate maximizes consumption he described the transaction demand for money rule before william baumol and james tobin 8 he was also responsible for early work in behavioral economics which in the us is generally attributed to daniel kahneman and amos tversky 9 in the 1940s allais worked on decision theory or theory of choice under uncertainty and developed a theory of cardinal utility due to war conditions and his commitment to publish in french his work was undertaken independently of theory of games and economic behavior developed by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern he formulated the allais paradox in 1953 which questions the traditional model of rationality of choices and contradicts the expected utility hypothesis it shows that when confronted with a lottery an individual does not maximize his hoped-for gains but rather aims at security rejection of the general equilibrium theory edit finally he criticizes the drifts of a discipline that privileges according to him mathematical virtuosity at the expense of realism with this new scholastic totalitarianism he moved away in the 60s from the analysis of the general equilibrium developed by walras and replace it with a study focusing on real markets rather than a utopian market favoring the study of imbalance and based on the idea of surplus the economic dynamics are thus characterized by the research the realization and the distribution of a surplus and there is a general equilibrium when there is no longer any realizable surplus allaiss hereditary relativist and logistic hrl theory of monetary dynamics contains an original theory of expectations formation that is a genuine alternative to both adaptive and rational expectations 10 it was praised by milton friedman in 1968 with the following words this work the hrl formulation introduces a very basic and important distinction between psychological time and chronological time it is one of the most important and original paper that has been written for a long time for its consideration of the problem of the formation of expectations 11 allaiss contribution has nevertheless been lost it has been absent from the debate about expectations 12 position against globalization edit on the first page he dedicates his book la mondialisation destruction des emplois et de la croissance 1990 globalization destruction of jobs and growth to the countless victims worldwide of the free-trade ideology ideology as fatal as it is erroneous and to all those who are not blind to some partisan passion 13 allais believes that ricardos theory is valid only in a steady state but disappears when the specializations evolve and when the capital is mobile according to him 14 globalization can only bring everywhere instability unemployment injustices and widespread globalization is neither inevitable nor necessary nor desirable he considers that 15 unemployment arise from the offshoring themselves due to the excessive differences in wages reasoned protectionism between countries with very different incomes is not only justified but absolutely necessary and the absence of protection will destroy all activities of each country with higher incomes in his opinion crisis and globalization are linked the financial and banking crisis which is only the spectacular symptom of a deeper economic crisis the deregulation 16 of competition in the global labor market 17 current unemployment is due to this total liberalization of trade as such it constitutes a major foolishness starting from an unbelievable contradiction just as attributing the crisis of 1929 to protectionist causes is a historical contradiction the true origin was already in the careless development of credit in the years preceding it in 1992 maurice allais criticised the maastricht treaty for its excessive emphasis on free trade he also expressed reservations on the single european currency 18 in 2005 he expressed similar reservations concerning the european constitution 19 contribution in physics edit main article allais effect besides his career in economics he performed experiments between 1952 and 1960 in the fields of gravitation special relativity and electromagnetism to investigate possible links between the fields he reported three effects an unexpected anomalous effect in the angular velocity of the plane of oscillation of a paraconical pendulum detected during two partial solar eclipses in 1954 and 1959 the claimed effect is now called the allais effect anomalous irregularities in the oscillation of the paraconical pendulum with respect to a sidereal diurnal periodicity of 23 hours 56 minutes and tidal periodicity of 24 hours 50 minutes anomalous irregularities in optical theodolite measurements with the same lunisolar periodicities over the years a number of pendulum experiments were performed by scientists around the world to test his findings however the results were mixed 20 21 bibliography edit les lignes
