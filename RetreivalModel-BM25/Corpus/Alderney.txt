essex who purchased the governorship of alderney in 1591 prior to the earls execution for treason in 1601 he leased the island to william chamberlain and alderney remained in the hands of the chamberlain family until 1643 from 1612 a judge was appointed to assist the governors administration of alderney along with the jurats the function of the judge was similar to that of the bailiffs of guernsey and jersey and continued until 1949 during the wars of the three kingdoms alderney was held by a parliamentary garrison under nicholas ling lieutenant-governor ling built government house now the island hall the de carterets of jersey acquired the governorship later passing it to sir edmund andros of guernsey from whom the guernsey family of le mesurier inherited it thus establishing a hereditary line of governors that lasted until 1825 henry le mesurier prospered through privateering and moved the harbour from longis to braye building a jetty there in 1736 warehouses and dwellings

of alderney the british government decided to undertake massive fortifications in the 19th century and to create a strategic harbour to deter attacks from france 8 these fortifications were presciently described by william ewart gladstone as a monument of human folly useless to us but perhaps not absolutely useless to a possible enemy with whom we may at some period have to deal and who may possibly be able to extract some profit in the way of shelter and accommodation from the ruins an influx of english and irish labourers plus the sizeable british garrison stationed in the island led to rapid anglicisation the harbour was never completed the remaining breakwater designed by james walker is one of the islands landmarks and is longer than any breakwater in the uk queen victoria and prince albert visited alderney on 9 august 1854 9 the albert memorial and the renaming of rue grosnez to victoria street commemorate this visit 4 at the same time as the breakwater was being built in the 1850s the island was fortified by a string of 13 forts designed to protect the harbour of refuge the accommodation quarters of several of the forts have been converted into apartments two are now private homes and one fort clonque at the end of a causeway that can be flooded at high tide belongs to the landmark trust and can be rented for comfortable self-catering holidays for up to 13

outlying rocks its access causeway and bridge having been swept away long ago houmet herb resembles a crusader castle with its squat round towers like many of the forts it included such apparently anachronistic features as a drawbridge and machicolation which were still common in military architecture of the period second world war edit main articles german occupation of the channel islands and fortifications of alderney in june 1940 the entire population of alderney about 1500 residents were evacuated most went on the official evacuation boats sent from mainland britain some however decided to make their own way mostly via guernsey but due to the impending occupation many found themselves unable to leave and were forced to stay on guernsey for the duration of the war a few alderney people elected not to leave alderney with the general evacuation however boats from guernsey came and collected them before the german army arrived on the basis that it was best for their personal safety during the second world war the channel islands were the only part of the british isles that was occupied by germany although other parts of the empire were occupied by the axis powers the germans arrived to a deserted island and began to follow their orders to fortify alderney as part of hitlers atlantic wall in january 1942 they built four camps in alderney two work camps lager helgoland and lager borkum and two concentration camps lager sylt and lager norderney they were built by the nazi organisation todt ot to house the labour used to build fortifications including

alderney on 16 may 1945 eight days after the allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of nazi germany and the end of adolf hitler s third reich and seven days after the liberation of guernsey and jersey 2332 german prisoners of war were removed from alderney on 20 may 1945 leaving 500 germans to undertake clearing up operations under british military supervision 10 the people of alderney could not start returning until december 1945 due to the huge cleanup operation needed simply to make the island safe for civilians when the islanders returned home they were

while others were paid by the local government out of the profit from the sales of farm produce 11 remaining profits were put aside to repay the british government for repairing and rebuilding the island the local people resented being unable to control their own land this led to the united kingdom home office setting up an enquiry that led to the government of alderney law 1948 which came into

judiciary were separated the position of judge who had headed the islands government since the resignation of the last governor in 1825 was abolished and the jurats were removed from their legislative function 4 because of the islands small population it was believed that the island could not be self-sufficient in running the airport and the harbour or providing services that would match those of
