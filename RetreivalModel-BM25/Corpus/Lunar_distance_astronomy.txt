lunar distance astronomy wikipedia lunar distance astronomy this article is about the average distance from the earth to the moon for its other use in navigation see lunar distance navigation lunar distance ld or also called earthmoon distance earthmoon characteristic distance or distance to the moon is a unit of measure in astronomy it is the average distance from the center of earth to the center of the moon more technically it is the mean semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit it may also refer to the time-averaged distance between the centers of the earth and the moon or less commonly the instantaneous earthmoon distance the lunar distance is approximately a quarter of a million miles 7008400000000000000 400 000 km 1 the mean semi-major axis has a value of 384402km 238856mi 2 the time-averaged distance between earth and moon centers is 3850006km 2392283mi the actual distance varies over the course of the orbit of the moon from 356500km 221500mi at the perigee to 406700km 252700mi at apogee resulting in a differential range of 50200km 31200mi 3 lunar distance is commonly used to express the distance to near-earth object encounters 4 lunar distance is also an important astronomical datum the precision of this measurement to a few parts in a trillion has useful implications for testing gravitational theories such as general relativity 5 and for refining other astronomical values such as earth mass 6 earth radius 7 and earths rotation 8 the measurement is also useful in characterizing the lunar radius the mass of the sun and the distance to the sun millimeter precision measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for light to travel between lidar stations on the earth and retroreflectors placed on the moon the moon is spiraling away from the earth at an average rate of 38cm 15in per year as detected by the lunar laser ranging experiment 9 10 11 by coincidence the diameter of corner cubes in retroreflectors on the moon is also 6998380000000000000 38cm 12 13 distance between the earth and moon sizes and distance to scale value edit variation edit the instantaneous lunar distance is constantly changing in fact the true distance between the moon and earth can change as quickly as 7001750000000000000 75meters per second 3 or more than 7006100000000000000 1000km in just 6 hours due to its non-circular orbit 17 there are other effects that also influence the lunar distance some factors are described in this section perturbations and eccentricity edit the distance to the moon can be measured to an accuracy of 6997200000000000000 2mm over a 1-hour sampling period 18 which results in an overall uncertainty of 6998200000000000000 23cm for the average distance however due to its elliptical orbit with varying eccentricity the instantaneous distance varies with monthly periodicity furthermore the distance is perturbed by the gravitational effects of various astronomical bodies most significantly the sun and less so by jupiter other forces responsible for minute perturbations are other planets in the solar system asteroids tidal forces and relativistic effects 19 the effect of radiation pressure from the sun contributes an amount of 6997360000000000000 36mm to the lunar distance 18 although the instantaneous uncertainty is sub-millimeter the measured lunar distance can change by more than 7007210000000000000 21 000 km from the mean value throughout a typical month these perturbations are well understood 20 and the lunar distance can be accurately modeled over thousands of years 19 the moons distance from the earth and moon phases in 2014 moon phases 0 1 new moon 0.25 first quarter 0.5 full moon 0.75 last quarter variation of the distance between the centers of the moon and the earth over 700 days tidal dissipation edit through the action of tidal forces angular momentum is slowly being transferred from earths rotation to the moons orbit the result is that earths rate of spin is imperceptibly decreasing at a rate of 7000229999999999999 23millisecondscentury 21 and the lunar orbit is gradually expanding the current rate of recession is 7000380500000000000 3.805 0004cm per year 20 however it is believed that this rate has recently increased as a rate of 6991120417206325883 38cmyear would imply that the moon is only 15billion years old whereas scientific consensus assumes an age of 4 billion years 22 it is also believed that this anomalously high rate of recession may continue to accelerate 23 it is predicted that the lunar distance will continue to increase until the earth and moon become tidally locked this would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of earth the two bodies will then be at equilibrium and no further rotational energy will be exchanged models predict that 50billion years would be required to achieve this configuration 24 which is significantly longer than the expected lifetime of the solar system orbital history edit the average lunar distance is increasing which implies that the moon was closer in the past there is geological evidence that the average lunar distance was about 52 r during the precambrian era 2500million years bp 22 the giant impact hypothesis a widely accepted theory states that the moon was created as a result of a catastrophic impact between another planet and earth resulting in a re-accumulation of fragments at an initial distance of 3.8 r 25 in this theory the initial impact is assumed to have occurred 45billion years ago 26 history of measurement edit until the late 1950s all measurements of lunar distance were based on optical angular measurements the space age marked a turning point which greatly advanced the precision and accuracy of our knowledge of this value during the 1950s and 1960s experiments were conducted that utilized radar lasers spacecraft and computer modeling 27 this section is intended to illustrate some of the historically significant or otherwise interesting methods of determining the lunar distance and is not intended to be an exhaustive or all-encompassing list parallax edit the oldest method of determining the lunar distance involves measuring the angle between the moon and a chosen reference point from multiple locations simultaneously the synchronization can be coordinated by making measurements at a pre-determined time or during an event which is observable to all parties before accurate mechanical chronometers the synchronization event was typically a lunar eclipse or the moment when the moon crossed the meridian if the observers shared the same longitude this measurement technique is known as lunar parallax for increased accuracy certain systematic errors must be accounted for such as adjusting the measured angle to account for refraction and distortion of light through the atmosphere lunar eclipse edit early attempts to measure the distance to the moon exploited observations of a lunar eclipse combined with knowledge of earths radius and an understanding that the sun is much further than the moon by observing the geometry of a lunar eclipse the lunar distance can be calculated using trigonometry the earliest account of an attempt to measure the distance to the moon using this technique was by the 4th-century-bc greek astronomer and mathematician aristarchus of samos 28 and later by hipparchus whose calculations produced a result of 59-67 r 29 this method later found its way into the work of ptolemy 30 who produced a result of 64 1 6 r at its farthest point 31 meridian crossing edit an expedition by french astronomer acd crommelin observed lunar transits through the meridian the moment when the moon crosses an imaginary great circle that passes directly overhead and through the celestial poles on the same night from two different locations careful measurements from 1905 through 1910 measured the angle of elevation at the moment when a specific lunar crater msting a crossed the meridian from stations at greenwich and at cape of good hope which share nearly the same longitude 32 a distance was calculated with an uncertainty of 30km and remained the definitive lunar distance value for the next half century occultations edit by recording the instant when the moon occults a background star or similarly measuring the angle between the moon and a background star at a predetermined moment the lunar distance can be determined as long as the measurements are taken from multiple locations of known separation astronomers okeefe and anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing 4 occultations from 9 locations in 1952 33 they calculated a mean distance of 7008384407600000000 384 407 6 47km however the value was refined by in 1962 by irene fischer who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of 7008384403700000000 384 403 7 2km 7 radar edit an experiment was conducted in 1957 at the us naval research laboratory that used the echo from radar signals to determine the earth-moon distance radar pulses lasting 6994200000000000000 2s were broadcast from a 7001152400000000000 50ft diameter radio dish after the radio waves echoed off the surface of the moon the return signal was detected and the delay time measured from that measurement the distance could be calculated in practice however the signal-to-noise ratio was so low that an accurate measurement could not be reliably produced 34 the experiment was repeated in 1958 at the royal radar establishment in england radar pulses lasting 6994499999999999999 5s were transmitted with a peak power of 2megawatts at a repetition rate of 260 pulses per second after the radio waves echoed off the surface of the moon the return signal was detected and the delay time measured multiple signals were added together to obtain a reliable signal by superimposing oscilloscope traces onto photographic film from the measurements the distance was calculated with an uncertainty of 7003125000000000000 125km 35 these initial experiments were intended to be proof-of-concept experiments and only lasted one day follow-on experiments lasting one month produced a mean value of 7008384402000000000 384 402 12km 36 which was the most accurate measurement of the lunar distance at the time laser ranging edit an experiment which measured the round-trip time of flight of laser pulses reflected directly off the surface of the moon was performed in 1962 by a team from massachusetts institute of technology and a soviet team at the crimean astrophysical observatory 37 during the apollo missions in 1969 astronauts placed retroreflectors on the surface of the moon for the purpose of refining the accuracy of this technique the measurements are ongoing and involve multiple laser facilities the instantaneous accuracy of the lunar laser ranging experiments can exceed sub-millimeter resolution and is the most reliable method of determining the lunar distance to date amateur astronomers and citizen scientists edit due to the modern accessibility to accurate timing devices high resolution digital cameras gps receivers powerful computers and near instantaneous communication it has become possible for amateur astronomers to make high accuracy measurements of the lunar distance on may 23 2007 digital photographs of the moon during a near-occultation of regulus were taken from two locations in greece and england by measuring the parallax between the moon and the chosen background star the lunar distance was calculated 38 a more ambitious project called the aristarchus campaign was conducted during the lunar eclipse of 15 april 2014 17 during this event participants were invited to record a series of 5 digital photographs from moonrise through culmination the point of greatest altitude the method took advantage of the fact that the moon is actually closest to an observer when it is at its highest point in the sky compared to when it is on the horizon although it appears that the moon is biggest when it is near the horizon the opposite is true this phenomenon is known as the moon illusion the reason for the change in distance results from the fact that the distance from the center of the moon to the center of earth is nearly constant throughout the night but an observer on the surface of earth is actually 1 earth radius from the center of earth this offset brings them closest to the moon when it is overhead modern cameras have now reached the resolution level capable of capturing the moon with a precision enough to perceive and more importantly to measure this tiny variation in apparent size the results of this experiment were calculated as ld 7001605100000000000 60.51 3.91 419 r the accepted value for that night was 60.61 which implied a 7000300000000000000 3 accuracy the benefit of this method is that the only measuring equipment needed is a modern digital camera equipped with an accurate clock and gps receiver other experimental methods of measuring the lunar distance that can be performed by amateur astronomers involve taking pictures of the moon before it enters into the penumbra and after it is completely eclipsed measuring as precise as possible the time of the eclipse contacts taking good pictures of the partial eclipse when the shape and size of the earth shadow is clearly visible taking a picture of the moon including in the same field of view spica and mars from various locations
