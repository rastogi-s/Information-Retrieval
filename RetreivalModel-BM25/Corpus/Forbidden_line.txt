forbidden mechanism wikipedia forbidden mechanism in spectroscopy a forbidden mechanism forbidden transition or forbidden line is a spectral line associated with absorption or emission of light by atomic nuclei atoms or molecules which undergo a transition that is not allowed by a particular selection rule but is allowed if the approximation associated with that rule is not made 1 for example in a situation where according to usual approximations such as the electric-dipole approximation for the interaction with light the process cannot happen but at a higher level of approximation eg magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole the process is allowed but at a much lower rate an example is phosphorescent glow in the dark materials 2 which absorb light and form an excited state whose decay involves a spin flip and is therefore forbidden by electric dipole transitions the result is emission of light slowly over minutes or hours although the transitions are nominally forbidden there is a small probability of their spontaneous occurrence should an atomic nucleus atom or molecule be raised to an excited state more precisely there is a certain probability that such an excited entity will make a forbidden transition to a lower energy state per unit time by definition this probability is much lower than that for any transition permitted or allowed by the selection rules therefore if a state can de-excite via a permitted transition or otherwise eg via collisions it will almost certainly do so before any transition occurs via a forbidden route nevertheless most forbidden transitions are only relatively unlikely states that can only decay in this way so-called meta-stable states usually have lifetimes on the order milliseconds to seconds compared to less than a microsecond for decay via permitted transitions in some radioactive decay systems multiple levels of forbiddenness can stretch life times by many orders of magnitude for each additional unit by which the system changes beyond what is most allowed under the selection rules citation needed such excited states can last years or even for many billions of years too long to have been measured in radioactive decay edit gamma decay edit the most common mechanism for suppression of the rate of gamma decay of excited atomic nuclei and thus make possible the existence of a metastable isomer for the nucleus is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum along any given direction by the most common allowed amount of 1 quantum unit of spin angular momentum such a change is necessary to emit a gamma-ray photon which has a spin of 1 unit in this system integral changes of 2 3 4 and more units in angular momentum are possible the emitted photons carry off the additional angular momentum but changes of more than 1 unit are known as forbidden transitions each degree of forbiddenness additional unit of spin change larger than 1 that the emitted gamma ray must carry inhibits decay rate by about 5 orders of magnitude 3 the highest known spin change of 8 units occurs in the decay of ta-180m which suppresses its decay by a factor of 10 35 from that associated with 1 unit so that instead of a natural gamma decay half life of 10 12 seconds it has a half life of more than 10 23 seconds or at least 3 x 10 15 years and thus has yet to be observed to decay although gamma decays with nuclear angular momentum changes of 2 3 4 etc are forbidden they are only relatively forbidden and do proceed but with a slower rate than the normal allowed change of 1 unit however gamma emission is absolutely forbidden when the nucleus begins in a zero-spin state as such an emission would not conserve angular momentum these transitions cannot occur by gamma decay but must proceed by another route such as beta decay in some cases or internal conversion where beta decay is not favored beta decay edit beta decays here are classified according to the l value of the emitted radiation unlike gamma decays beta decays may proceed from a nucleus with a spin of zero and even parity to a nucleus also with a spin of zero and even parity fermi transition this is possible because the electron and neutrino emitted may be of opposing spin giving a radiation total angular momentum of zero thus preserving angular momentum of the initial state even if the nucleus remains at spin-zero before and after emission this type of emission is super-allowed meaning that it is the most rapid type of beta decay in nuclei that are susceptible to a change in protonneutron ratios that accompanies a beta decay process the next possible total angular momentum of the electron and neutrino emitted in beta decay is a combined spin of 1 electron and neutrino spinning in the same direction and is allowed this type of emission gamow-teller transition changes nuclear spin by a unit of 1 to compensate states involving higher angular momenta of the emitted radiation 2 3 4 etc are forbidden and are ranked in degree of forbiddenness by their increasing angular momentum specifically when l 0 the decay is referred to as forbidden nuclear selection rules require l-values greater than two to be accompanied by changes in both nuclear spin j and parity the selection rules for the l th forbidden transitions are where 1 or 1 corresponds to no parity change or parity change respectively as noted the special case of a fermi 0 0 transition which in gamma decay is absolutely forbidden is referred to as super-allowed for beta decay and proceeds very quickly if beta decay is possible the following table lists the j and values for the first few values of l as with gamma decay each degree of increasing forbiddenness increases the half life of the beta decay process involved by a factor of about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude 4 double beta decay has been observed in the laboratory e g in 82 se 5 geochemical experiments have also found this rare type of forbidden decay in several isotopes 6 with mean half lives over 10 18 yr in solid-state physics edit forbidden transitions in rare earth atoms such as erbium and neodymium make them useful as dopants for solid-state lasing media in such media the atoms are held in a matrix which keeps them from de-exciting by collision and the long half life of their excited states makes them easy to optically pump to create a large population of excited atoms neodymium doped glass derives its unusual coloration from forbidden f f transitions within the neodymium atom and is used in extremely high power solid state lasers bulk semiconductor transitions can also be forbidden by symmetry which change the functional form of the absorption spectrum as can be shown in a tauc plot in astrophysics and atomic physics edit forbidden emission lines have been observed in extremely low density gases and plasmas either in outer space or in the extreme upper atmosphere of the earth 7 in space environments densities may be only a few atoms per cubic centimetre making atomic collisions unlikely under such conditions once an atom or molecule has been excited for any reason into a meta-stable state then it is almost certain to decay by emitting a forbidden-line photon since meta-stable states are rather common forbidden transitions account for a significant percentage of the photons emitted by the ultra-low density gas in space forbidden transitions in highly charged ions resulting in the emission of visible vacuum-ultraviolet soft x-ray and x-ray photons are routinely observed in certain laboratory devices such as electron beam ion traps 8 and ion storage rings where in both cases residual gas densities are sufficiently low for forbidden line emission to occur before atoms are collisionally de-excited using laser spectroscopy techniques forbidden transitions are used to stabilize atomic clocks and quantum clocks that have the highest accuracies currently available forbidden lines of nitrogen n ii at 654.8 and 658.4 nm sulfur s ii at 671.6 and 6731nm and oxygen o ii at 3727nm and o iii at 495.9 and 5007nm are commonly observed in astrophysical plasmas these lines are important to the energy balance of planetary nebulae and h ii regions the forbidden 21-cm hydrogen line is particularly important for radio astronomy as it allows very cold neutral hydrogen gas to be seen also the presence of o i and s ii forbidden lines in the spectra of t-tauri stars implies low gas density notation edit forbidden line transitions are noted by placing square brackets around the atomic or molecular species in question eg o iii or s ii 7
