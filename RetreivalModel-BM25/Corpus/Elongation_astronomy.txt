elongation astronomy wikipedia elongation astronomy for other uses see elongation disambiguation in astronomy a planets elongation is the angular separation between the sun and the planet with earth as the reference point the greatest elongation of a given inferior planet occurs when this planets position in its orbital path around the sun is at tangent to the observer on earth since an inferior planet is well within the area of earths orbit around the sun observation of its elongation should not pose that much a challenge compared to deep-sky objects for example when a planet is at its greatest elongation it appears farthest from the sun as viewed from earth so its apparition is also best at that point when an inferior planet is visible after sunset it is near its greatest eastern elongation when an inferior planet is visible before sunrise it is near its greatest western elongation the angle of the maximum elongation east or west for mercury is between 18 and 28 while that for venus is between 45 and 47 these values vary because the planetary orbits are elliptical rather than perfectly circular another factor contributing to this inconsistency is orbital inclination in which each planets orbital plane is slightly tilted relative to a reference plane like the ecliptic and invariable planes astronomical tables and websites such as heavens-above forecast when and where the planets reach their next maximum elongations elongation period edit greatest elongations of a planet happen periodically with a greatest eastern elongation followed by a greatest western elongation and vice versa the period depends on the relative angular velocity of earth and the planet as seen from the sun the time it takes to complete this period is the synodic period of the planet let t be the period for example the time between two greatest eastern elongations be the relative angular velocity e earths angular velocity and p the planets angular velocity then where t e and t p are earths and the planets years ie periods of revolution around the sun called sidereal periods for example venus s year sidereal period is 225 days and earth s is 365 days thus venuss synodic period which gives the time between two subsequent eastern or western greatest elongations is 584 days these values are approximate because as mentioned above the planets do not have perfectly circular coplanar orbits when a planet is closer to the sun it moves faster than when it is further away so exact determination of the date and time of greatest elongation requires a much more complicated analysis of orbital mechanics elongation of superior planets edit superior planets dwarf planets and asteroids undergo a different cycle after conjunction such an objects elongation continues to increase until it approaches a maximum value larger than 90 impossible with inferior planets and typically very near 180 which is known as opposition and corresponds to a heliocentric conjunction with earth in other words as seen by an observer on the superior planet at opposition the earth appears at conjunction with the sun technically the exact moment of opposition is slightly different from the moment of maximum elongation opposition is defined as the moment when the apparent ecliptic longitudes of the superior planet and the sun differ by 180 which ignores the fact that the planet is outside the plane of the earths orbit for example pluto whose orbit is highly inclined to the earths orbital plane can have a maximum elongation significantly less than 180 at opposition all superior planets are most easily visible at their oppositions because they are near their closest approach to earth and are also above the horizon all night the variation in magnitude caused by changes in elongation are greater the closer the planets orbit is to the earths mars magnitude in particular changes with elongation it can be as low as 1.8 when in conjunction near aphelion but at a rare favourable opposition it is as high as 29 or seventy-five times brighter than its minimum brightness as one moves further out the difference in magnitude caused by the difference in elongation gradually fall the maximum and minimum brightness of jupiter differ by only a factor of 3.3 times whilst those of uranus which is the most distant solar system body visible to the naked eye differ by a factor of 1.7 times since asteroids travel in an orbit not much larger than the earths their magnitude can vary greatly depending on elongation although more than a dozen objects in the asteroid belt can be seen with 10x50 binoculars at an average opposition only ceres and vesta are always above the binocular limit of 9.5 at small elongations a quadrature occurs when the position of a body moon or planet is such that its elongation is 90 or 270 ie the body-earth-sun angle is 90 elongation of moons of other planets edit sometimes elongation may instead refer to the angular distance of a moon of another planet from its central planet for instance the angular distance of io from jupiter here we can also talk about greatest eastern elongation and greatest western elongation in the case of the moons of uranus one often talks about greatest northern elongation and greatest southern elongation instead due to the very high inclination of uranus axis of rotation
