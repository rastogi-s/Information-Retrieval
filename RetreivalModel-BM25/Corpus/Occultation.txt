occultation wikipedia occultation for the shia islamic belief see the occultation for the social phenomenon see social occultation an occultation is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer the term is often used in astronomy but can also refer to any situation in which an object in the foreground blocks from view occults an object in the background in this general sense occultation applies to the visual scene observed from low-flying aircraft or computer-generated imagery when foreground objects obscure distant objects dynamically as the scene changes over time occultations by the moon edit the term occultation is most frequently used to describe those relatively frequent occasions when the moon passes in front of a star during the course of its orbital motion around the earth since the moon with an angular speed with respect to the stars of 0.55 arcsec s or 2.7 rads has a very thin atmosphere and stars have an angular diameter of at most 0.057 arcseconds or 0.28 rad a star that is occulted by the moon will disappear or reappear in 0.1 seconds or less on the moons edge or limb events that take place on the moons dark limb are of particular interest to observers because the lack of glare allows these occultations to more easily be observed and timed the moons orbit is inclined to the ecliptic see orbit of the moon and any stars with an ecliptic latitude of less than about 6.5 degrees may be occulted by it there are three first magnitude stars that are sufficiently close to the ecliptic that they may be occulted by the moon and by planets regulus spica and antares 1 occultations of aldebaran are presently only possible by the moon because the planets pass aldebaran to the north neither planetary nor lunar occultations of pollux are currently possible however in the far future occultations of pollux will be possible as they were in the far past some deep-sky objects such as the pleiades can also be occulted by the moon within a few kilometres of the edge of an occultations predicted path referred to as its northern or southern limit an observer may see the star intermittently disappearing and reappearing as the irregular limb of the moon moves past the star creating what is known as a grazing lunar occultation from an observational and scientific standpoint these grazes are the most dynamic and interesting of lunar occultations the accurate timing of lunar occultations is performed regularly by primarily amateur astronomers lunar occultations timed to an accuracy of a few tenths of a second have various scientific uses particularly in refining our knowledge of lunar topography photoelectric analysis of lunar occultations have also discovered some stars to be very close visual or spectroscopic binaries some angular diameters of stars have been measured by timing of lunar occultations which is useful for determining effective temperatures of those stars early radio astronomers found occultations of radio sources by the moon valuable for determining their exact positions because the long wavelength of radio waves limited the resolution available through direct observation this was crucial for the unambiguous identification of the radio source 3c 273 with the optical quasar and its jet 2 and a fundamental prerequisite for maarten schmidt s discovery of the cosmological nature of quasars several times during the year someone on earth can usually observe the moon occulting a planet 3 since planets unlike stars have significant angular sizes lunar occultations of planets will create a narrow zone on earth from which a partial occultation of the planet will occur an observer located within that narrow zone could observe the planets disk partly blocked by the slowly moving moon the same mechanic can be seen with the sun where observers on earth will view it as a solar eclipse therefore a total solar eclipse is effectively the same event as the moon occulting the sun occultation by planets edit main article planetary transits and occultations stars may also be occulted by planets occultations of bright stars are rare in 1959 venus occulted regulus and the next occultation of a bright star also regulus by venus will be in 2044 1 uranus s rings were first discovered when that planet occulted a star in 1977 on 3 july 1989 saturn passed in front of the 5th magnitude star 28 sagittarii pluto occulted stars in 1988 2002 and 2006 allowing its tenuous atmosphere to be studied via atmospheric limb sounding mutual planetary occultations edit in rare cases one planet can pass in front of another if the nearer planet appears larger than the more distant one the event is called a mutual planetary occultation occultations by asteroids edit an asteroid occultation occurs when an asteroid or more generically minor planet passes in front of a star occults a star temporarily blocking its light as seen from earth 4 several events occur nearly every day over the world from any particular place such events occur almost every night although most require a telescope to see professionals and amateurs around the globe are collaborating over the internet to exchange their observation for a joint analysis 5 asteroid occultations are useful for measuring the size and position of asteroids much more precisely than can be done by any other means a cross-sectional profile of the shape of an asteroid can even be determined if a number of observers at different nearby locations observe the occultation for example on 12 march 2009 there were 8 minor planet occulations including 85 io 247 eukrate 1585 union 201 penelope 70 panopaea 980 anacostia 2448 sholokhov 1746 brouwer and 191 kolga any one of these would be expected to occult at a time and place on the globe at a certain magnitude and with a certain star 5 for example according to the 1998 european asteroidal occultation results from euraster 39 laetitia was observed by over 38 observatories in one occultation on 3 march 1998 which resulted in many chords being determined 6 regulus was occulted by the asteroid 163 erigone in the early morning of march 20 2014 7 as first predicted by a vitagliano in 2004 8 this was the brightest asteroid occultation ever predicted to occur over a populated area as the main belt asteroid passed in front of the star its 67-mile-wide 100km shadow swept across nassau and suffolk counties all of new york city and the hudson river valley with the center of the shadow path following a line roughly connecting new york city white plains newburgh oneonta rome and pulaski before crossing into canada near belleville and north bay ontario 7 8 bad weather obscured the occultation 9 occultations have produced outlines of many asteroids some notable ones include occultations have also been used to estimate the diameter of trans-neptunian objects such as 55636 2002 tx 300 28978 ixion and 20000 varuna preliminary results of a 6 november 2010 occultation by the dwarf planet eris of a magnitude 17 star in the constellation of cetus placed an upper limit on eriss diameter of 2320km making it almost the same size as pluto 10 due to their slower movement through the night sky occultations by tnos are far less common than by asteroids in the main-belt stellar occultations by kuiper belt objects edit the dwarf planet haumea was observed in a stellar transit on 21 january 2017 identifying a ring on june 3 2017 a star was occulted by the kuiper belt object 2014 mu69 the first such occultation detected 11 the multi-faceted campaign involved cooperation from the argentinian government including local governments a major highway was closed for two hours and street lights were turned off in order to preclude light pollution three spacecraft 24 portable ground-based telescopes and nasas sofia airborne observatory in the most challenging stellar occultation in the history of astronomy in an effort spanning six months 12 double occultations edit the moon or another celestial body can occult multiple celestial bodies at the same time because of its relatively large angular diameter the moon at any given time occults an indeterminate number of stars however an event when the moon occults two bright objects eg two planets or a bright star and a planet simultaneously is extremely rare and can be seen only from a small part of the world the last event of such type was on 23 april 1998 when the moon occulted venus and jupiter for observers on ascension island occulting satellites edit the big occulting steerable satellite boss was a proposed satellite that would work in conjunction with a telescope to detect planets around distant stars the satellite consists of a large very lightweight sheet and a set of maneuvering thrusters and navigation systems it would maneuver to a position along the line of sight between the telescope and a nearby star the satellite would thereby block the radiation from the star permitting the orbiting planets to be observed 13 the proposed satellite would have a dimension of 70 m 70 m a mass of about 600kg and maneuver by means of an ion drive engine in combination with using the sheet as a light sail positioned at a distance of 100000km from the telescope it would block more than 99.998 of the starlight there are two possible configurations of this satellite the first would work with a space telescope most likely positioned near the earth s l 2 lagrangian point the second would place the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit about the earth and work in conjunction with a ground telescope at the apogee of the orbit the satellite would remain relatively stationary with respect to the ground allowing longer exposure times an updated version of this design is called the starshade which uses a sunflower shaped coronagraph disc a comparable proposal was also made for a satellite to occult bright x-ray sources called an x-ray occulting steerable satellite or xoss 14
