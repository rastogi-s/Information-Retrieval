the united kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative cornish assembly and powers similar to those in wales and scotland 8 9 in 2014 cornish people were granted minority status under the european framework convention for the protection of national minorities 10 giving cornish people recognition as a distinct ethnic group 11 12 first inhabited in the palaeolithic and mesolithic periods cornwall continued to be occupied by neolithic and then bronze age peoples and later in the iron age by brythons with strong trade and cultural links to wales and brittany mining in cornwall and devon in the south west of england began in the early bronze age few roman remains have been found in cornwall and there is little evidence that the romans settled or had much military presence there citation needed after the collapse of the roman empire cornwall was ruled by chieftains of the cornovii which may have included semi-historical or legendary figures such as king mark of cornwall and king arthur evidenced by folklore traditions derived from the historia regum britanniae the cornovii division of the dumnonii tribe were separated from the brythons of wales after the battle of deorham and often came into conflict with the expanding kingdom of wessex king athelstan in ad 936 set the boundary between english and cornish at the high water mark of the eastern bank of the river tamar 13 from the early middle ages language and culture were shared by brythons trading across both sides of the channel resulting in the corresponding high medieval breton kingdoms of domnone and cornouaille and the celtic christianity common to both areas historically tin mining in britain was important in the cornish economy becoming increasingly significant during the high middle ages and expanding greatly during the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production in the mid-19th century however the tin and copper mines entered a period of decline subsequently china clay extraction became more important and metal mining had virtually ended by the 1990s traditionally fishing particularly of pilchards and agriculture notably dairy products and vegetables were the other important sectors of the economy railways led to a growth of tourism in the 20th century however cornwalls economy struggled after the decline of the mining and fishing industries citation needed cornwall is noted for its geology and coastal scenery a large part of the cornubian batholith is within cornwall the north coast has many cliffs where exposed geological formations are studied the area is noted for its wild moorland landscapes its long and varied coastline its attractive villages its many place-names derived from the cornish language and its very mild climate extensive stretches of cornwalls coastline and bodmin moor are protected as an area of outstanding natural beauty 14 name and emblems the modern english name cornwall is a compound of two ancient demonyms coming from two different language groups corn originates from the brythonic tribe the cornovii peninsula people the celtic word kernou horn or headland is cognate with the english word horn both deriving from the proto-indo-european ker 15 16 17 18 a wall derives from the old english exonym wealh meaning foreigner or roman ie a welshman in the cornish language cornwall is known as kernow which stems from a similar linguistic background flag main article saint pirans flag saint pirans flag is the national flag and ancient banner of cornwall 20 21 22 and an emblem of the cornish people it is regarded as the county flag by cornwall council the banner of saint piran is a white cross on a black background in terms of heraldry sable a cross argent according to legend saint piran adopted these colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his discovery of tin 20 23 the cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former breton national flag black cross and is known by the same name kroaz du 24 25 heraldry main articles cornish heraldry and cornish corporate heraldry in later times cornwall was known to the anglo-saxons as west wales to distinguish it from north wales the modern nation of wales 26 the name appears in the anglo-saxon chronicle in 891 as on corn walum in the domesday book it was referred to as cornualia and in c 1198 as cornwal 27 b other names for the county include a latinisation of the name as cornubia first appears in a mid-9th-century deed purporting to be a copy of one dating from c 705 and as cornugallia in 1086 physical geography main articles geography of cornwall and geology of cornwall cornwall forms the tip of the south-west peninsula of the island of great britain and is therefore exposed to the full force of the prevailing winds that blow in from the atlantic ocean the coastline is composed mainly of resistant rocks that give rise in many places to tall cliffs cornwall has a border with only one other county devon which is formed almost entirely by the river tamar and the remainder to the north by the marsland valley coastal areas the north and south coasts have different characteristics the north coast on the celtic sea part of the atlantic ocean is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature the prosaically named high cliff between boscastle and st gennys is the highest sheer-drop cliff in cornwall at 223 metres 732ft 29 however there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches that are so important to the tourist industry such as those at bude polzeath watergate bay perranporth porthtowan fistral beach newquay st agnes st ives and on the south coast gyllyngvase beach in falmouth and the large beach at praa sands further to the south west there are two river estuaries on the north coast hayle estuary and the estuary of the river camel which provides padstow and rock with a safe harbour the seaside town of newlyn is a popular holiday destination as it is one of the last remaining traditional cornish fishing ports with views reaching over mounts bay the south coast dubbed the cornish riviera is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages such as at falmouth and fowey beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle interspersed with rocky sections of wave-cut platform also on the south coast the picturesque fishing village of polperro at the mouth of the pol river and the fishing port of looe on the river looe are both popular with tourists inland areas the interior of the county consists of a roughly eastwest spine of infertile and exposed upland with a series of granite intrusions such as bodmin moor which contains the highest land within cornwall from east to west and with approximately descending altitude these are bodmin moor hensbarrow north of st austell carnmenellis to the south of camborne and the penwith or lands end peninsula these intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the cornubian batholith of south-west britain which also includes dartmoor to the east in devon and the isles of scilly to the west the latter now being partially submerged the intrusion of the granite into the surrounding sedimentary rocks gave rise to extensive metamorphism and mineralisation and this led to cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in europe until the early 20th century it is thought tin was mined here as early as the bronze age and copper lead zinc and silver have all been mined in cornwall alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of china clay especially in the area to the north of st austell and the extraction of this remains an important industry the uplands are surrounded by more fertile mainly pastoral farmland near the south coast deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist mild climate these areas lie mainly on devonian sandstone and slate the north east of cornwall lies on carboniferous rocks known as the culm measures in places these have been subjected to severe folding as can be seen on the north coast near crackington haven and in several other locations lizard peninsula main article lizard complex the geology of the lizard peninsula is unusual in that it is mainland britains only example of an ophiolite a section of oceanic crust now found on land c much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red precambrian serpentinite which forms spectacular cliffs notably at kynance cove and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops this ultramafic rock also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula

and shallots 76 pasties are often locally referred to as oggies historically pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam apple and blackberry plums or cherries 77 the wet climate and

post-roman periods see also dumnonia the present human history of cornwall begins with the reoccupation of britain after the last ice age the area now known as cornwall was first inhabited in the palaeolithic and mesolithic periods it continued to be occupied by neolithic and then bronze age people according to john t koch and others cornwall in the late bronze age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the atlantic bronze age in modern-day ireland england france spain and portugal 82 83 during the british iron age cornwall like all of britain south of the firth of forth was inhabited by a celtic people known as the britons with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring wales and brittany the common brittonic spoken at the time eventually developed into several distinct tongues including cornish 84 the first account of cornwall comes from the 1st century bc sicilian greek historian diodorus siculus supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century bce geographer pytheas who had sailed to britain the inhabitants of that part of britain called belerion or lands end from their intercourse with foreign merchants are civilised in their manner of life they prepare the tin working very carefully the earth in which it is produced here then the merchants buy the tin from the natives and carry it over to gaul and after travelling overland for about thirty days they finally bring their loads on horses to the mouth of the rhne 85 the identity of these merchants is unknown it has been theorised that they were phoenicians but there is no evidence for this 86 professor timothy champion discussing diodorus siculuss comments on the tin trade states that diodorus never actually says that the phoenicians sailed to cornwall in fact he says quite the opposite the production of cornish tin was in the hands of the natives of cornwall and its transport to the mediterranean was organised by local merchants by sea and then over land through france well outside phoenician control 87 for further discussion of tin mining see the section on the economy below there is little evidence that roman rule was effective west of exeter in devon and few roman remains have been found however after 410 cornwall appears to have reverted to rule by romano-celtic chieftains of the cornovii tribe as part of dumnonia including one marcus cunomorus with at least one significant power base at tintagel king mark of cornwall is a semi-historical figure known from welsh literature the matter of britain and in particular the later norman-breton medieval romance of tristan and yseult where he is regarded as a close relative of king arthur himself usually considered to be born of the cornish people in folklore traditions derived from geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae archaeology supports ecclesiastical literary and legendary evidence for some relative economic stability and close cultural ties between the sub-roman westcountry south wales brittany and ireland through the fifth and sixth centuries 88 conflict with wessex the battle of deorham in 577 saw the separation of dumnonia and therefore cornwall from wales following which the dumnonii often came into conflict with the expanding english kingdom of wessex the annales cambriae report that in 722 ad the britons of cornwall won a battle at hehil 89 it seems likely that the enemy the cornish fought was a west saxon force as evidenced by the naming of king ine of wessex and his kinsman nonna in reference to an earlier battle of lining in 710 90 the anglo-saxon chronicle stated in 815 adjusted date and in this year king ecgbryht raided in cornwall from east to west and thenceforth apparently held it as a ducatus or dukedom annexed to his regnum or kingdom of wessex but not wholly incorporated with it 91 the anglo-saxon chronicle states that in 825 adjusted date a battle took place between the wealas cornish and the defnas men of devon at gafulforda in the same year ecgbert as a later document expresses it disposed of their territory as it seemed fit to him giving a tenth part of it to god in other words he incorporated cornwall ecclesiastically with the west saxon diocese of sherborne and endowed eahlstan his fighting bishop who took part in the campaign with an extensive cornish estate consisting of callington and lawhitton both in the tamar valley and pawton near padstow in 838 the cornish and their danish allies were defeated by egbert in the battle of hingston down at hengestesdune probably hingston down in cornwall in 875 the last recorded king of cornwall dumgarth is said to have drowned 92 around the 880s anglo-saxons from wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of cornwall notably alfred the great who had acquired a few estates 93 william of malmesbury writing around 1120 says that king athelstan of england 924939 fixed the boundary between english and cornish people at the east bank of the river tamar 13 bretonnorman period one interpretation of the domesday book is that by this time the native cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by english landowners particularly harold godwinson himself however the bodmin manumissions show that two leading cornish figures nominally had saxon names but these were both glossed with native cornish names 94 naming evidence cited by medievalist edith ditmas suggests that many post-conquest landowners in cornwall were breton allies of the normans 95 and further proposed this period for the early composition of the tristan and iseult cycle by poets such as beroul from a pre-existing shared brittonic oral tradition 96 soon after the norman conquest most of the land was transferred to the new bretonnorman aristocracy with the lions share going to robert count of mortain half-brother of king william and the largest landholder in england after the king with his stronghold at trematon castle near the mouth of the tamar 97 cornwall and devon west of dartmoor showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of saxon wessex and places continued even after 1066 to be named in the celtic cornish tradition with saxon architecture being uncommon citation needed later medieval administration and society subsequently however norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new cornu-norman elite including scholars such as richard rufus of cornwall these families eventually became the new ruling class of cornwall typically speaking norman french breton-cornish latin and eventually english many becoming involved in the operation of the stannary parliament system earldom and eventually the duchy 98 the cornish language continued to be spoken and it acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from breton stannary parliaments main article stannary courts and parliaments the stannary parliaments and stannary courts were legislative and legal institutions in cornwall and in devon in the dartmoor area england the stannary courts administered equity for the regions tin-miners and tin mining interests and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines the separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the english economy during the middle ages special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in britain and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in cornwall and devon from any
