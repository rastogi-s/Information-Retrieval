atmosphere of the moon wikipedia atmosphere of the moon the atmosphere of the moon is a very scant presence of gases surrounding the moon for most practical purposes the moon is considered to be surrounded by vacuum the elevated presence of atomic and molecular particles in its vicinity compared to interplanetary medium referred to as lunar atmosphere for scientific objectives is negligible in comparison with the gaseous envelopes surrounding earth and most planets of the solar system the pressure of this small mass is around 3 10 15 atm 0.3 npa varying throughout the day and in total weighs less than 10 metric tonnes 2 3 otherwise the moon is considered not to have an atmosphere because it cannot absorb measurable quantities of radiation does not appear layered or self-circulating and requires constant replenishment due to the high rate at which its gases are lost to space sources edit one source of the lunar atmosphere is outgassing the release of gases such as radon and helium resulting from radioactive decay within the crust and mantle another important source is the bombardment of the lunar surface by micrometeorites the solar wind and sunlight in a process known as sputtering 4 losses edit gases can either be re-implanted into the regolith as a result of the moons gravity escape the moon entirely if the particle is moving at or above the lunar escape velocity of 238kms 148mis be lost to space either by solar radiation pressure or if the gases are ionized by being swept away in the solar winds magnetic field composition edit what little atmosphere the moon has consists of some unusual gases including sodium and potassium which are not found in the atmospheres of earth mars or venus at sea level on earth each cubic centimeter of the atmosphere contains approximately 10 19 molecules by comparison the lunar atmosphere contains fewer than 10 6 molecules in the same volume on earth this is considered to be a very good vacuum in fact the density of the atmosphere at the moons surface is comparable to the density of the outermost fringes of earths atmosphere where the international space station orbits 5 the elements sodium and potassium have been detected in the moons atmosphere using earth-based spectroscopic methods whereas the isotopes radon 222 and polonium 210 have been inferred from data obtained by the lunar prospector alpha particle spectrometer 6 argon 40 helium 4 oxygen andor methane ch 4 nitrogen n 2 andor carbon monoxide co and carbon dioxide co 2 were detected by in-situ detectors placed by the apollo astronauts 7 the average daytime abundances of the elements known to be present in the lunar atmosphere in atoms per cubic centimeter are as follows argon 20000100000 8 helium 500030000 8 neon up to 20000 8 9 sodium 70 potassium 17 hydrogen fewer than 17 this yields approximately 80000 total atoms per cubic centimeter marginally higher than the quantity posited to exist in the atmosphere of mercury 7 while this greatly exceeds the density of the solar wind which is usually on the order of just a few protons per cubic centimeter it is virtually a vacuum in comparison with the atmosphere of the earth the moon may also have a tenuous atmosphere of electrostatically-levitated dust see moon dust for more details past thicker atmosphere edit in october 2017 nasa scientists at the marshall space flight center and the lunar and planetary institute in houston announced their finding based on studies of moon magma samples retrieved by the apollo missions that the moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago this atmosphere sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions was twice the thickness of that of present-day mars the ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space 10
