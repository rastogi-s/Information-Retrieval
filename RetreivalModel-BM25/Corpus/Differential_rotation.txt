differential rotation wikipedia differential rotation differential rotation is seen when different parts of a rotating object move with different angular velocities rates of rotation at different latitudes andor depths of the body andor in time this indicates that the object is not solid in fluid objects such as accretion disks this leads to shearing galaxies and protostars usually show differential rotation examples in the solar system include the sun jupiter and saturn around the year 1610 galileo galilei observed sunspots and calculated the rotation of the sun in 1630 christoph scheiner reported that the sun had different rotational periods at the poles and at the equator in good agreement with modern values the cause of differential rotation edit because of the pre-stellar accretion phase and the conservation of angular momentum rotation is induced differential rotation is caused by convection in stars which is a movement of mass due to steep temperature gradients from the core outwards this mass carries a portion of the stars angular momentum thus redistributing the angular velocity possibly even far enough out for the star to lose angular velocity in stellar winds differential rotation thus depends on temperature differences in adjacent regions measuring differential rotation edit there are many ways to measure and calculate differential rotation in stars to see if different latitudes have different angular velocities the most obvious being tracking spots on the stellar surface by doing helioseismological measurements of solar p-modes it is possible to deduce the differential rotation the sun has very many acoustic modes that oscillate in the interior simultaneously and the inversion of their frequencies can yield the rotation of the solar interior this varies with both depth and especially latitude the broadened shapes of absorption lines in the optical spectrum depend on v rot sini where i is the angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis permitting the study of the rotational velocitys line-of-sight component v rot this is calculated from fourier transforms of the line shapes using equation 2 below for v rot at the equator and poles see also plot 2 solar differential rotation is also seen in magnetograms images showing the strength and location of solar magnetic fields effects of differential rotation edit gradients in angular rotation caused by angular momentum redistribution within the convective layers of a star are expected to be a main driver for generating the large-scale magnetic field through magneto-hydrodynamical dynamo mechanisms in the outer envelopes the interface between these two regions is where angular rotation gradients are strongest and thus where dynamo processes are expected to be most efficient the inner differential rotation is one part of the mixing processes in stars mixing the materials and the heatenergy of the stars differential rotation affects stellar optical absorption line spectra through line broadening caused by lines being differently doppler-shifted across the stellar surface solar differential rotation causes shear at the so-called tachocline this is a region where rotation changes from differential in the convection zone to nearly solid-body rotation in the interior at 0.71 solar radii from the center calculating differential rotation edit for observed sunspots the differential rotation can be calculated as where is the rotation rate at the equator and is the difference in angular velocity between pole and equator called the strength of the rotational shear is the heliographic latitude measured from the equator the reciprocal of the rotational shear is the lap time ie the time it takes for the equator to do a full lap more than the poles the relative differential rotation rate is the ratio of the rotational shear to the rotation rate at the equator the doppler rotation rate in the sun measured from doppler-shifted absorption lines can be approximated as where is the co-latitude measured from the poles differential rotation of the sun edit see also solar rotation on the sun the study of oscillations revealed that rotation is roughly constant within the whole radiative interior and variable with radius and latitude within the convective envelope the sun has an equatorial rotation speed of 2kms its differential rotation implies that the angular velocity decreases with increased latitude the poles make one rotation every 34.3 days and the equator every 25.05 days as measured relative to distant stars sidereal rotation the highly turbulent nature of solar convection and anisotropies induced by rotation complicate the dynamics of modeling molecular dissipation scales on the sun are at least six orders of magnitude smaller than the depth of the convective envelope a direct numerical simulation of solar convection would have to resolve this entire range of scales in each of the three dimensions consequently all solar differential rotation models must involve some approximations regarding momentum and heat transport by turbulent motions that are not explicitly computed thus modeling approaches can be classified as either mean-field models or large-eddy simulations according to the approximations differential rotation of the milky way edit see also milky way and oort constants disk galaxies dont rotate like solid bodies but rather rotate differentially the rotation speed as a function of radius is called a rotation curve and is often interpreted as a measurement of the mass profile of a galaxy as where is the rotation speed at radius is the total mass enclosed within radius
