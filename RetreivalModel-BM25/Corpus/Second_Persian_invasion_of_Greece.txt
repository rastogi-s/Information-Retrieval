second persian invasion of greece wikipedia second persian invasion of greece the second persian invasion of greece 480479 bc occurred during the greco-persian wars as king xerxes i of persia sought to conquer all of greece the invasion was a direct if delayed response to the defeat of the first persian invasion of greece 492490 bc at the battle of marathon which ended darius i s attempts to subjugate greece after dariuss death his son xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion mustering an enormous army and navy the athenians and spartans led the greek resistance about a tenth of the greek city-states joined the allied effort most remained neutral or submitted to xerxes the invasion began in spring 480 bc when the persian army crossed the hellespont and marched through thrace and macedon to thessaly the persian advance was blocked at the pass of thermopylae by a small allied force under king leonidas i of sparta simultaneously the persian fleet was blocked by an allied fleet at the straits of artemisium at the famous battle of thermopylae the allied army held back the persian army for seven days before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated the allied fleet had also withstood two days of persian attacks at the battle of artemisium but when news reached them of the disaster at thermopylae they withdrew to salamis after thermopylae all of boeotia and attica fell to the persian army which captured and burnt athens however a larger allied army fortified the narrow isthmus of corinth protecting the peloponnesus from persian conquest both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter the course of the war the athenian general themistocles succeeded in luring the persian navy into the narrow straits of salamis where the huge number of persian ships became disorganised and were soundly beaten by the allied fleet the allied victory at salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion and fearing becoming trapped in europe xerxes retreated to asia leaving his general mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army the following spring the allies assembled the largest ever hoplite army and marched north from the isthmus to confront mardonius at the ensuing battle of plataea the greek infantry again proved its superiority inflicting a severe defeat on the persians and killing mardonius in the process on the same day across the aegean sea an allied navy destroyed the remnants of the persian navy at the battle of mycale with this double defeat the invasion was ended and persian power in the aegean severely dented the greeks would now move to the offensive eventually expelling the persians from europe the aegean islands and ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 bc sources edit main article herodotus the main source for the great greco-persian wars is the greek historian herodotus herodotus who has been called the father of history 3 was born in 484 bc in halicarnassus asia minor then under persian overlordship he wrote his enquiries greek historia english the histories around 440430 bc trying to trace the origins of the greco-persian wars which would still have been relatively recent history the wars finally ending in 450 bc 4 herodotuss approach was entirely novel and at least in western society he does seem to have invented history as we know it 4 as holland has it for the first time a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous nor to the whims and wishes of some god nor to a peoples claim to manifest destiny but rather explanations he could verify personally 4 some subsequent ancient historians despite following in his footsteps criticised herodotus starting with thucydides 5 6 nevertheless thucydides chose to begin his history where herodotus left off at the siege of sestos and therefore evidently felt that herodotuss history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting 6 plutarch criticised herodotus in his essay on the malignity of herodotus describing herodotus as philobarbaros barbarian-lover for not being pro-greek enough which suggests that herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed 7 a negative view of herodotus was passed on to renaissance europe though he remained well read 8 however since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events 9 the prevailing modern view is that herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his historia but that some of his specific details particularly troop numbers and dates should be viewed with skepticism 9 nevertheless there are still some historians who believe herodotus made up much of his story 10 the greek historian diodorus siculus from sicily writing in the 1st century bc in his bibliotheca historica also provides an account of the greco-persian wars partially derived from the earlier greek historian ephorus this account is fairly consistent with herodotuss 11 the greco-persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including plutarch ctesias and are alluded by other authors such as the playwright aeschylus archaeological evidence such as the serpent column also supports some of herodotuss specific claims 12 background edit main articles greco-persian wars and first persian invasion of greece the greek city-states of athens and eretria had supported the unsuccessful ionian revolt against the persian empire of darius i in 499494 bc the persian empire was still relatively young and prone to revolts among its subject peoples 13 14 moreover darius was a usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule 13 the ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire and darius thus vowed to punish those involved especially those not already part of the empire 15 16 darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of ancient greece 16 a preliminary expedition under mardonius in 492 bc to secure the land approaches to greece ended with the re-conquest of thrace and forced macedon to become a fully subordinate kingdom part of persia 17 18 it had previously been a vassal as early as the late 6th century bc but remained having autonomy and not fully subordinate yet 18 in 491 bc darius sent emissaries to all the greek city-states asking for a gift of earth and water in token of their submission to him 19 having had a demonstration of his power the previous year the majority of greek cities duly obliged in athens however the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed in sparta they were simply thrown down a well 19 this meant that sparta was also now effectively at war with persia 19 darius thus put together an ambitious task force under datis and artaphernes in 490 bc which attacked naxos before receiving the submission of the other cycladic islands the task force then moved on eretria which it besieged and destroyed 20 finally it moved to attack athens landing at the bay of marathon where it was met by a heavily outnumbered athenian army at the ensuing battle of marathon the athenians won a remarkable victory which resulted in the withdrawal of the persian army to asia 21 darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate greece however in 486 bc his egyptian subjects revolted indefinitely postponing any greek expedition 14 darius then died while preparing to march on egypt and the throne of persia passed to his son xerxes i 22 xerxes crushed the egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of greece 23 persian preparations edit since this was to be a full-scale invasion it required long-term planning stock-piling and conscription 23 it was decided that xerxes pontoon bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the hellespont to europe and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of mount athos rounding which headland a persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 bc 24 these were both feats of exceptional ambition which would have been beyond any contemporary state 24 however the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in egypt and babylonia 25 in 481 bc after roughly four years of preparation xerxes began to muster the troops for the invasion of europe herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted 26 the persian army was gathered in asia minor in the summer and autumn of 481 bc the armies from the eastern satrapies was gathered in kritala cappadocia and were led by xerxes to sardis where they passed the winter 27 early in spring it moved to abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies 28 then the army that xerxes had mustered marched towards europe crossing the hellespont on two pontoon bridges 29 size of the persian forces edit army edit the numbers of troops that xerxes mustered for the second invasion of greece have been the subject of endless dispute because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed herodotus claimed that there were in total 2.5 million military personnel accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel 30 the poet simonides who was a contemporary talks of four million ctesias based on persian records gave 800000 as the total number of the army without the support personnel that was assembled by xerxes 31 while it has been suggested that herodotus or his sources had access to official persian empire records of the forces involved in the expedition modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the persian military systems their logistical capabilities the greek countryside and supplies available along the armys route 1 modern scholars thus generally attribute the numbers given in the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors or disinformation by the persians in the run up to the war 2 the topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300000500000 1 2 nevertheless whatever the real numbers were it is clear that xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea 1 and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease never returning to asia 32 herodotus tells us that the army and navy while moving through thrace was halted at doriskos for an inspection by xerxes and he recounts the numbers of troops found to be present 33 the 30 marines are in addition to the figure of 200 given for the ships crews there is some contradiction in herodotuss accounts the figure of 240000 is derived from 3000 penteconters the 47th ethnic group is missing from herodotuss text the term asian is herodotus but under that term he also includes arabians and north africans herodotus doubles this number to account for support personnel and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5283220 men 30 other ancient sources give similarly large numbers the poet simonides who was a near-contemporary talks of four million ctesias gave 800000 as the total number of the army that assembled in doriskos 31 an early and very influential modern historian george grote set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by herodotus to admit this overwhelming total or anything near to it is obviously impossible 67 grotes main objection is the supply problem though he does not analyse the problem in detail he did not reject herodotuss account altogether citing the latters reporting of the persians careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources 67 a later influential historian j b bury calls herodotuss numbers wholly fabulous and judges that the persian land forces may have been 180000 68 a major limiting factor for the size of the persian army first suggested by sir frederick maurice a british transport officer is the supply of water 69 maurice suggested in the region of 200000 men and 70000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of greece he further suggested that herodotus may have confused the persian terms for chiliarchy 1000 and myriarchy 10000 leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten 69 other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100000 soldiers or less based on the logistical systems available to the ancients 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 munro and macan note herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 myriarchs leaders of a baivabaram the basic unit of the persian infantry which numbered about 10000-strong 78 79 this would give a land force of roughly 300000 men 80 81 other proponents of larger numbers suggest figures from 250000 to 700000 82 83 fleet edit the size of the persian fleet is also disputed though perhaps less so 84 according to herodotus the persian fleet numbered 1207 triremes and 3000 transport and supply ships including 50-oared galleys penteconters 37 herodotus gives a detailed breakdown of the persian triremes herodotus also records that this was the number at the battle of salamis despite the losses earlier in storms off sepia and euboea and at the battle of artemisium he claims that the losses were replenished with reinforcements though he only records 120 triremes from the greeks of thrace and an unspecified number of ships from the greek islands aeschylus who fought at salamis also claims that he faced 1207 warships there of which 1000 were triremes and 207 fast ships 85 diodorus 86 and lysias 87 independently claim there were 1200 at doriskos the number of 1207 for the outset only is also given by ephorus 88 while his teacher isocrates claims there were 1300 at doriskos and 1200 at salamis 89 90 ctesias gives another number 1000 ships 31 while plato speaking in general terms refers to 1000 ships and more 91 these numbers are by ancient standards consistent and this could be interpreted that a number around 1200 is correct among modern scholars some have accepted this number although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the battle of salamis 92 93 94 other recent works on the persian wars reject this number1207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined greek fleet in the iliad and generally claim that the persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the aegean 94 95 96 greek preparations edit the athenians had been preparing for war with the persians since the mid-480s bc and in 482 bc the decision was taken under the guidance of the politician themistocles to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the greeks to fight the persians 97 the athenians did not have the man-power to fight on land and sea therefore combatting the persians would require an alliance of several greek city states in 481 bc xerxes sent ambassadors around greece asking for earth and water but making the very deliberate omission of athens and sparta 98 support thus began to coalesce around these two states hellenic alliance edit a congress of states met at corinth in late autumn of 481 bc and a confederate alliance of greek city-states was formed 99 this confederation had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them the greeks and the greeks who had sworn alliance godley translation or the greeks who had banded themselves together rawlinson translation 100 hereafter they will be referred to as the allies sparta and athens had a leading role in the congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy 101 little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings only 70 of the approximately 700 greek cities sent representatives nevertheless this was remarkable for the disjointed greek world especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other 102 the majority of other city-states remained more-or-less neutral awaiting the outcome of the confrontation 103 thebes was a major absentee and was suspected of being willing to aid the persians once the invasion force arrived 103 104 not all thebans agreed with this policy and 400 loyalist hoplites joined the allied force at thermopylae at least according to one possible interpretation 104 the most notable city actively siding with the persians medised was argos in the otherwise spartan-dominated peloponnese 105 106 however the argives had been severely weakened in 494 bc when a spartan-force led by cleomenes i had annihilated the argive army in battle of sepeia and then massacred the fugitives 106 size of allied forces edit further information battle of thermopylae battle of artemisium battle of salamis battle of plataea and battle of mycale the allies had no standing army nor was there any requirement to form one since they were fighting on home territory they could muster armies as and when required different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign these numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle spring 480 bc thrace macedonia and thessaly edit having crossed into europe in april 480 bc the persian army began its march to greece five major food depots had been set up along the path at white headland on the thracian side of the hellespont at tyrodiza in perinthian territory at doriskos at the evros river estuary where the asian army was linked up with the balkan allies at eion on the strymon river and at therme modern-day thessaloniki there food had been sent from asia for several years in preparation for the campaign animals had been bought and fattened while the local populations had for several months been ordered to grind the grains into flour 107 the persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the hellespont to therme a journey of about 600km 360mi it paused at doriskos where it was joined by the fleet xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march 108 the allied congress met again in the spring of 480 bc a thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow vale of tempe on the borders of thessaly and thereby block xerxess advance 109 a force of 10000 allies led by the spartan polemarch euenetus and themistocles was thus despatched to the pass however once there they were warned by alexander i of macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes and that the army of xerxes was overwhelming the allies therefore retreated 110 shortly afterwards they received the news that xerxes had crossed the hellespont 110 the abandonment of tempe meant that all of thessaly submitted to the persians as did many cities to the north of the pass of thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming 111 a second strategy was therefore suggested to the allies by themistocles the route to southern greece boeotia attica and the peloponnesus would require the army of xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of thermopylae this could easily be blocked by the allies despite the overwhelming number of persians furthermore to prevent the persians bypassing thermopylae by sea the allied navy could block the straits of artemisium this dual strategy was adopted by the congress 112 however the peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the isthmus of corinth should it come to it while the women and children of athens were evacuated en masse to the peloponnesian city of troezen 113 august 480 bc thermopylae and artemisium edit main articles battle of thermopylae and battle of artemisium when the allies received the news that xerxes was clearing paths around mount olympus and thus intending to march towards thermopylae it was both the period of truce that accompanied the olympic games and the spartan festival of carneia during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious 114 nevertheless the spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king leonidas i with his personal bodyguard the hippeis of 300 men in this case the elite young soldiers in the hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons 114 leonidas was supported by contingents from the peloponnesian cities allied to sparta and other forces that were picked up en route to thermopylae 114 the allies proceeded to occupy the pass rebuilt the wall the phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass and waited for xerxess arrival 115 when the persians arrived at thermopylae in mid-august they initially waited for three days for the allies to disperse when xerxes was eventually persuaded that the allies intended to contest the pass he sent his troops to attack 116 however the greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare the persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on 117 the allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything xerxes could throw at them however at the end of the second day they were betrayed by a local resident named ephialtes who revealed to xerxes a mountain path that led behind the allied lines xerxes then sent his elite guards the immortals on a night march to outflank the allied when he was made aware of this maneuver while the immortals were still en route leonidas dismissed the bulk of the allied army remaining to guard the rear with 300 spartans 700 thespians 400 thebians and perhaps a few hundred others on the third day of the battle the remaining allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the persians and slaughter as many as they could 118 ultimately however the allied rearguard was annihilated and the pass of thermopylae opened to the persians 119 simultaneous with the battle at thermopylae an allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the straits of artemisium against the persians 120 directly before artemisium the persian fleet had been caught in a gale off the coast of magnesia losing many ships but could still probably muster over 800 ships at the start of the battle 121 on the first day also the first of the battle of thermopylae the persians detached 200 seaworthy ships which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of euboea these ships were to round euboea and block the line of retreat for the allied fleet 121 meanwhile the allies and the remaining persians engaged in the late afternoon the allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels 121 that evening another storm occurred wrecking the majority of the persian detachment which had been sent around euboea 122 on the second day of the battle news reached the allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened they therefore resolved to maintain their position they staged a hit-and-run attack on some cilician ships capturing and destroying them 123 on the third day however the persian fleet attacked the allies lines in full force in a day of savage fighting the allies held on to their position but suffered severe losses 124 half the athenian fleet was damaged 125 nevertheless the allies inflicted equal losses on the persian fleet 124 that evening the allies received news of the fate of leonidas and the allies at thermopylae since the allied fleet was badly damaged and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of thermopylae they retreated from artemisium to the island of salamis 126 september 480 bc salamis edit main article battle of salamis victory at thermopylae meant that all boeotia fell to xerxes the two cities that had resisted him thespiae and plataea were captured and razed attica was also left open to invasion and the remaining population of athens was thus evacuated with the aid of the allied fleet to salamis 127 the peloponnesian allies began to prepare a defensive line across the isthmus of corinth building a wall and demolishing the road from megara thereby abandoning athens to the persians 128 athens thus fell the small number of athenians who had barricaded themselves on the acropolis were eventually defeated and xerxes then ordered athens to be torched 129 the persians had now captured most of greece but xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance from the greeks his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible 130 the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely and probably xerxes did not wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long 131 thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended greek position had little chance of success 132 with the allies now dug in across the isthmus there was therefore little chance of the persians conquering the rest of greece by land however if the isthmuss defensive line could be outflanked the allies could be defeated 133 134 such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the persian navy and thus the neutralisation of the allied navy 131 134 in summary if xerxes could destroy the allied navy he would be in a strong position to force a greek surrender this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season 131 conversely by avoiding destruction or as themistocles hoped by destroying the persian fleet the greeks could avoid conquest in the final reckoning both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war 135 thus it was that the allied fleet remained off the coast of salamis into september despite the imminent arrival of the persians even after athens fell to the advancing persian army the allied fleet still remained off the coast of salamis trying to lure the persian fleet to battle 135 136 partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of themistocles the navies finally engaged in the cramped straits of salamis 132 there the large persian numbers were an active hindrance as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised 137 seizing the opportunity the greek fleet attacked and scored a decisive victory sinking or capturing at least 200 persian ships and thus ensuring the peloponnesus would not be outflanked 138 according to herodotus after this loss xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the straits to attack salamis although strabo and ctesias place this attempt before the battle in any case this project was soon abandoned with the persians naval superiority removed xerxes feared that the greeks might sail to the hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges 139 according to herodotus mardonius volunteered to remain in greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops while advising xerxes to retreat to asia with the bulk of the army 140 all of the persian forces abandoned attica with mardonius over-wintering in boeotia and thessaly 130 the athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter 130 autumnwinter 480479 bc edit siege of potidaea edit herodotus tells us that a persian general artabazus having escorted xerxes to the hellespont with 60000 men began the return journey to mardonius in thessaly 141 however as he neared pallene he thought it right that he should enslave the people of potidaea whom he found in revolt despite attempts to capture the greek city by treachery 142 the persians were forced to keep up the siege for three months 143 then attempting to use an unusually low tide to attack the town from sea the persian army was caught by the returning tide many drowning and the survivors being attacked by the potideans in boats 143 artabazus was thus forced to lift the siege and return to mardonius with the remnants of his men 143 siege of olynthus edit while besieging potidea artabazus also decided to besiege olynthus which was also in revolt 144 the town was held by the bottiaean tribe who had been driven out of macedon 144 having taken the town he massacred the defenders and handed over the town to the chalcidian people 144 june 479 bc plataea and mycale edit main articles battle of plataea and battle of mycale over the winter there seems to have been some tension between the allies in particular the athenians who were not protected by the isthmus but whose fleet were the key to the security of the peloponnesus felt hard done by they demanded an allied army march north the following year 145 when the other allies failed to commit to this the athenian fleet probably refused to join the allied navy in the spring 146 the navy now under the command of the spartan king leotychides thus skulked off delos while the remnants of the persian fleet skulked off samos both sides unwilling to risk battle 146 similarly mardonius remained in thessaly knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless while the allies refused to send an army outside the peloponessus 145 mardonius moved to break the stalemate by offering peace self-government and territorial expansion to the athenians with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the allied forces using alexander i of macedon as an intermediary 146 the athenians made sure that a spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer but rejected it 146 athens was thus evacuated again and the persians marched south and re-took possession of it 146 mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the athenian refugees on salamis athens along with megara and plataea sent emissaries to sparta demanding assistance and threatening to accept the persian terms if not 147 the spartans who were at that time celebrating the festival of hyacinthus delayed making a decision for 10 days 148 however when the athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the spartans they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the persians 149 when mardonius heard that the allied army was on the march he retreated into boeotia near plataea trying to draw the allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry 150 the allied army however under the command of the spartan regent pausanias stayed on high ground above plataea to protect themselves against such tactics 151 mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the greek lines 152 but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed 153 the outcome prompted the allies to move to a position nearer the persian camp still on high ground 154 as a result the allied lines of communication were exposed the persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the allies 151 the allied position now undermined pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions 151 this went awry leaving the athenians and spartans and tegeans isolated on separate hills with the other contingents scattered further away near plataea itself 151 seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack mardonius ordered his whole army forward 155 156 however as at thermopylae the persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured greek hoplites 157 and the spartans broke through to mardoniuss bodyguard and killed him 158 the persian force thus dissolved in rout 40000 troops managed to escape via the road to thessaly 159 but the rest fled to the persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the allies thus finalising their victory 156 160 on the afternoon of the battle of plataea herodotus tells us that rumour of the allied victory reached the allied navy at that time off the coast of mount mycale in ionia 161 their morale boosted the allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the battle of mycale that same day destroying the remnants of the persian fleet 162 as soon as the peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus the athenian fleet under xanthippus had joined up with the rest of the allied fleet 162 the fleet now able to match the persians had first sailed to samos where the persian fleet was based 163 the persians whose ships were in a poor state of repair had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach under mycale an army of 60000 men had been left there by xerxes and the fleet joined with them building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships 163 however leotychides decided to attack the camp with the allied fleets marines 162 seeing the small size of the allied force the persians emerged from the camp but the hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the persian force 162 the ships were abandoned to the allies who burnt them crippling xerxes sea power and marking the ascendancy of the allied fleet 162 aftermath edit main article greco-persian wars with the twin victories of plataea and mycale the second persian invasion of greece was over moreover the threat of future invasion was abated although the greeks remained worried that xerxes would try again over time it became apparent that the persian desire to conquer greece was much diminished 164 in many ways mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict the greek counterattack 165 after the victory at mycale the allied fleet sailed to the hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges but found that this was already done 166 the peloponnesians sailed home but the athenians remained to attack the chersonesos still held by the persians 166 the persians in the region and their allies made for sestos the strongest town in the region which the athenians then laid siege to after a protracted siege it fell to the athenians 167 herodotus ended his historia after the siege of sestos over the next 30 years the greeks primarily the athenian-dominated delian league would expel the persians from macedon thrace the aegean islands and ionia 167 peace with persia came in 449 bc with the peace of callias finally ending the half-century of warfare 167 tactical analysis edit main articles hoplite and phalanx the greek style of warfare had been honed over the preceding centuries 168 169 it revolved around the hoplite members of the middle-classes the zeugites who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner 170 the hoplite was by the standards of the time heavily armoured with a breastplate originally bronze but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version greaves a full helmet and a large round shield the aspis 169 hoplites were armed with a long spear the doru which was evidently significantly longer than persian spears and a sword the xiphos 169 hoplites fought in the phalanx formation the exact details are not completely clear but it was a close-knit formation presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields and spears to the enemy 168 properly assembled the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon 171 172 on occasions when it is recorded to have happened it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx 171 the phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry if caught on the wrong terrain however 173 the hoplites heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat 169 and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers even if the shield did not stop a missile there was a reasonable chance the armour would 169 the persian infantry used in the invasion were a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire however according to herodotus there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting 174 the troops were generally speaking armed with a bow short spear and sword carried a wicker shield and wore at most a leather jerkin 174 175 the one exception to this may have been the ethnic persian troops who may have worn a corslet of scaled armour 174 some of the contingents may have been armed somewhat differently 174 for instance the saka were renowned axemen 176 the elite contingents of the persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic persians medians cissians and the saka 174 the foremost of the infantry were the royal guards the immortals although they were still armed in the aforementioned style 174 177 cavalry was provided by the persians bactrians medes cissians and saka most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry 174 178 the style of fighting used by the persians was probably to stand off from an enemy using their bows or equivalent to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword 174 the persians had encountered hoplites in battle before at ephesus where their cavalry had easily routed the probably exhausted greeks 179 however at the battle of marathon the athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the persian infantry albeit in the absence of any cavalry 180 it is therefore slightly surprising that the persians did not bring any hoplites from the greek regions especially ionia under their control in asia 174 equally herodotus tells us that the egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed and performed well against the greek marines yet no egyptian contingent served in the army 169 the persians may not have completely trusted the ionians and egyptians since both had recently revolted against persian rule however if this is the case then it must be questioned why there were greek and egyptian contingents in the navy the allies evidently tried to play on the persian fears about the reliability of the ionians in persian service 181 182 but as far as we can tell both the ionians and egyptians performed particularly well for the persian navy 174 it may therefore simply be that neither the ionians nor egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet none of the coastal regions of the persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army 174 in the two major land battles of the invasion the allies clearly adjusted their tactics to nullify the persian advantage in numbers and cavalry by occupying the pass at thermopylae and by staying on high ground at plataea 183 at thermopylae until the path outflanking the allied position was revealed the persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation although the position was well chosen to limit the persian options 177 184 at plataea the harassing of the allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic forcing the precipitous and nearly disastrous retreat however mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry which resulted in the persian defeat 185 the events at mycale reveal a similar story persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites with disastrous results 162 it has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the greco-persian wars 186 however as simple as the greek tactics were they played to their strengths the persians however may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite and their failure to adapt to facing the allied infantry contributed to the eventual persian defeat 174 186 186 strategic analysis edit at the beginning of the invasion it is clear that the persians held most advantages 187 regardless of its actual size it is clear that the persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to greece 1 188 the persians had a unified command system and everyone was answerable to the king 189 they had a hugely efficient bureaucracy which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning 24 190 191 the persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the persian empire had been established 192 furthermore the persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare as shown by their nearly successful attempts to divide-and-conquer the greeks 193 194 195 the greeks by comparison were fragmented with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the persian invasion even those were prone to quarrel with each other 196 they had little experience of large-scale warfare being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare 197 and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing rather than because of any experience or expertise 198 as lazenby therefore asks so why did the persians fail 187 the persian strategy for 480 bc was probably to simply progress through greece in overwhelming force 185 the cities in any territory that the army passed through would be forced to submit or risk destruction and indeed this happened with the thessalian locrian and phocian cities who initially resisted the persians but then were forced to submit as the persians advanced 199 200 conversely the allied strategy was probably to try and stop the persian advance as far north as possible and thus prevent the submission of as many potential allies as possible 187 beyond this the allies seem to have realised that given the persians overwhelming numbers they had little chance in open battle and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks where the persian numbers would count for less 187 the whole allied campaign for 480 bc can be seen in this context initially they attempted to defend the tempe pass to prevent the loss of thessaly 187 after they realised that they could not defend this position they chose the next-most northerly position the thermopylaeartemisium axis 187 the allied performance at thermopylae was initially effective however the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked thermopylae undermined their strategy and led to defeat 187 at artemisium the fleet also scored some successes but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained and since the defeat of thermopylae made the position irrelevant 201 thus far the persian strategy had succeeded while the allied strategy though not a disaster had failed the defence of the isthmus of corinth by the allies changed the nature of the war the persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land realising they probably could not breach it 202 203 this essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one 187 themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the allied campaign to lure the persian fleet to battle in the straits of salamis 187 204 however as successful as this was there was no need for the persians to fight at salamis to win the war it has been suggested that the persians were either overconfident or overeager to finish the campaign 187 205 thus the allied victory at salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a persian strategic blunder 187 after salamis the persian strategy changed mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the allies in order to fracture the alliance 185 in particular he sought to win over the athenians which would leave the allied fleet unable to oppose persian landings on the peloponnesus 145 although herodotus tells us that mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle his actions in the run-up to plataea are not particularly consistent with this 187 he seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms but he waited either for the allies to attack or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously 187 the allied strategy for 479 bc was something of a mess the peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance and it appears that the allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win 187 it was the botched attempt to retreat from plataea that finally delivered the allies battle on their terms 185 mardonius may have been overeager for victory there was no need to attack the allies and by doing so he played to the main allied tactical strength combat in the melee 185 the allied victory at plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a persian mistake 185 thus the persian failure may be seen partly as a result of two strategic mistakes that handed the allies tactical advantages and resulted in decisive defeats for the persians 185 the allied success is often seen as the result of free men fighting for their freedom 206 this may have played a part and certainly the greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms 207 one crucial factor in the allied success was that having formed an alliance however fractious they remained true to it despite the odds 185 there appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt but ultimately it withstood and while this alone did not defeat the persians it meant that even after the occupation of most of greece the allies were not themselves defeated 187 this is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of athens thespiae and plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the persians 208 ultimately the allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats 187 stuck to their alliance 185 took advantage of persian mistakes 185 and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict which at plataea allowed them to destroy the persian invasion force 169 significance edit the second persian invasion of greece was an event of major significance in european history a large number of historians hold that had greece been conquered the ancient greek culture that lies at the basis of western civilization would have never developed and by extension western civilization itself 209 210 211 while this may be an exaggeration it is clear that even at the time the greeks understood that something very significant had happened 212 militarily there was not much in the way of tactical or strategic innovation during the persian invasion one commentator suggesting it was something of a soldiers war ie it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war 213 thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a force multiplier 214 while themistocless ruse before salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare the major lesson of the invasion reaffirming the events at the battle of marathon was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed persian infantry 164 169 taking on this lesson the persian empire would later after the peloponnesian war start recruiting and relying on greek mercenaries 215
