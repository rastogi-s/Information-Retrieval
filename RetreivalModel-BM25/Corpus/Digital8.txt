digital8 wikipedia digital8 digital8 or d8 is an obsolete consumer digital recording videocassette for camcorders based on the 8 mm video format developed by sony and introduced in 1999 the digital8 format is a combination of the earlier analog hi8 tape transport with the digital dv codec digital8 equipment uses the same videocassettes as analog recording hi8 equipment but the signal is encoded digitally using the industry-standard dv codec which means it has identical digital audio and digital video specifications compared with dv to facilitate digital recording on existing hi8 video cassettes the helical scan video head drum spins 25 faster for both ntsc and pal digital8 equipment a standard-length 120-minute ntsc90-minute pal hi8 magnetic tape cassette will store 60 minutes of digital8 video standard play or 90 minutes long play lp is model specific such as the trv-30 trv-40 and others digital8 recordings can be made on standard-grade video8 cassettes but this practice is discouraged in the sony user manuals and hi8 metal-particle cassettes are the recommended type for digital8 recording most hi8 tapes sold after the introduction of d8 are marked for both hi8 and digital8 usage minidvdvc vs digital8 edit contrary to popular perception the digital8 format is not technically inferior to minidv both are identical at the bitstream level from a user standpoint digital8 is dv or rather equivalent to and compatible with consumer minidv at an application level for example in a 1394firewire link a digital8 camcorder appears and behaves exactly like a mini dv camcorder digital8 and mini dv use different non-interchangeable cassette media with digital8 cassettes being the physically larger of the two the two formats may also use different media formulations digital8 can use metal-particle or metal-evaporated media while minidv is based solely on metal-evaporated media the maximum recording time for digital8 and minidv is 135 minutes and 130 minutes respectively using d-90 and dvm-85 tapes these extra-thin extra-long tapes are rare and expensive 1 2 3 in addition digital8 uses tape at 29mm per second more like the higher-end dvcam 28mms and dvcpro 34mms minidv uses tape at 19mms according to sonys press release of january 7 1999 for the minidv format one frame is recorded onto 10 tracks with the digital8 format one frames worth of information is recorded vertically onto 25 tracks the use of this recording method enables digital images to be recorded on a hi8 tape market segment edit while analog hi8 video enjoyed widespread use by amateur home video current affairs tv programs and some professional news organizations digital8 seems to have remained strictly a consumer or amateur product this is likely a reflection of sonys design and market objectives for digital8 format to serve as a lower cost upgrade path for current customers from analog 8mm by leveraging existing manufacturing infrastructure of 8mm video equipment and offering a familiar media format but with digital capabilities furthermore digital8 was released some time after minidv giving the rival dv format a lead in the professional market while little or no digital8 equipment has been produced for the professional market there are no technical barriers opposing its development in fact digital8 cameras have been used on the professional side of the filmtv business example hall of mirrors the movie digital8 is an obsolete format by 2004 sony the formats original backer was the only company still producing digital8 equipment and had no plans to develop new digital 8 cameras hitachi marketed a few digital8 camcorders for a while but no longer did so by that point by 2005 and later the digital8 product line catered purely to the entry-level consumer this is most likely because the larger bulkier digital8 cassette is perceived as an inferior technology even though the digital8 and dv formats offer indistinguishable av performance in fact the larger 8mm format is more robust laying down wider tracks most though not all digital8 camcorders can play back analogue video8 and hi8 tapes as well as camcorders sony also released digital8 video walkman portables the gv-d200 and gv-d800 camera model variations edit in the early years after digital8s introduction sony sold a product line with coverage from entry level to high-end consumer the more consumer oriented line uses a 16 ccd image sensor and the more prosumer line uses a 14 one both existed from the beginning but the 14 ccd models were discontinued some models allow an lp recording mode thus giving 90 minutes on a standard hi8 tape examples are the 2003 trv-150 250 350 and 351 models interestingly the owners manual is the same for all of these models and the trv-118 318 and 418 hi8 versions both general variants use a tiny 3mm ccd although the pixel count varies between the digital8 460k and the hi8 320k models although the 14 ccd models are fully capable of taking a still photo that is a secondary function and they lack the sony memory stick feature to off-load the jpeg images most of the entry level and later models focused on features such as better quality still pictures see below off-loading the same via sony memory sticks and more programming selections the combining of still image and video capture is now common however a good still image ccd has different qualities from a good video ccd the cameras also lost features generally appealing to a prosumer level customer the 1999 trv-310 for instance has the 14 ccda full 3.5 lcd screen now only found on the very professional sony minidv models an f14 lens variable shutter speed settings manual focus and other professional controls the lens on a typical 16 ccd is f18 about 60 as fast as an f14 the trv-310 has a 14 ccd with a pixel count of 460k and effective count of 290k the larger ccd with fewer pixels allows a smaller depth of field for intentional blurred backgrounds in some situations unattainable with the 16 ccd it also has greater light sensitivity 1 lux vs 7 lux for the 16 ccd without night shot and less sensor noise in low light conditions another example of these capabilities changing with pixel count may be seen in the trv-150 250 350 and 351 digital8 models and their trv-118 318 and 418 hi8 cousins despite having the same size ccd and the same f16 lens the lower pixel count hi8 models permit a 1 lux low light rating as compared to the 4 lux of the digital8 models the sony dcr-trv730828830 and the later dcr-trv740840 were the only digital8 camcorders to be built with a 147-inch 45mm with advanced had hole accumulation diode ccd had is useful on smaller high-megapixel-count ccds and cmoss the pixel count for the trv-730 is 1070000 pixels 690000 in camera mode analog recordings edit higher-end digital8 equipment may minimize analog generation loss by offering the ability to playback and digitize legacy analog 8mm video8hi8 format recordings but none will record in analog there are limitations audio playback is limited to the video8hi8 analog fm soundtrack not any pcm digital audio track analog recordings also lack of timecode so batch captures will not work 1 the video signal can be recorded through the camcorders firewire cable port simplifying video file creation on computers equipped with video capturing hardware and software and firewire equipped dvd recorders the advantage of creating digital files using the cameras digital stream conversion is that the resulting files on the computer can be burned to dvds as well as facilitating computerized digital editing and storage as video files lossless digital editing can be achieved when utilizing the firewire port between two similar digital8 cameras digitizing legacy signals does not improve image quality the resulting files have highly accurate sampling of the source audio and video quality of the video8hi8 original the models of digital8 camcorders released by sony that are not capable of analog video8hi8 playback usually the lower-end models include the following 2 dcr-trv130 2001 dcr-trv140 2002 dcr-trv145 dcr-trv147 dcr-trv150 2003 dcr-trv245 dcr-trv250 2003 dcr-trv260 2004 dcr-trv265 2004 dcr-trv280 2005 dcr-trv380 2005 the models of sony digital8 camcorder that are capable of both digital and analog playback include these models 3 additionally all models released by hitachi offer analogue playback dcr-tr7000 1999 dcr-trv103 1998 dcr-trv110 playback of hi8 and video8 in splp but record and playback of digital8 in sp only dcr-trv120 2000
