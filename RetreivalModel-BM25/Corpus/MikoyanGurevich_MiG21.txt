mikoyan-gurevich mig-21 wikipedia mikoyan-gurevich mig-21 the mikoyan-gurevich mig-21 russian 21 nato reporting name fishbed is a supersonic jet fighter and interceptor aircraft designed by the mikoyan-gurevich design bureau in the soviet union it was popularly nicknamed balalaika from the aircrafts planform-view resemblance to the russian stringed musical instrument or owek english pencil by polish pilots due to the shape of its fuselage 2 early versions are considered second-generation jet fighters while later versions are considered third-generation jet fighters citation needed approximately 60 countries over four continents have flown the mig-21 and it still serves many nations six decades after its maiden flight it made aviation records became the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history the most-produced combat aircraft since the korean war and previously the longest production run of a combat aircraft now exceeded by both the mcdonnell douglas f-15 eagle and general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon development edit origins edit the mig-21 jet fighter was a continuation of soviet jet fighters starting with the subsonic mig-15 and mig-17 and the supersonic mig-19 a number of experimental mach 2 soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings such as the sukhoi su-7 or tailed deltas of which the mig-21 would be the most successful development of what would become the mig-21 began in the early 1950s when mikoyan okb finished a preliminary design study for a prototype designated ye-1 in 1954 this project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered the redesign led to the second prototype the ye-2 both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings the first prototype with delta wings as found on production variants was the ye-4 it made its maiden flight on 16 june 1955 and its first public appearance during the soviet aviation day display at moscows tushino airfield in july 1956 in the west due to the lack of available information early details of the mig-21 often were confused with those of similar soviet fighters of the era in one instance janes all the worlds aircraft 19601961 listed the fishbed as a sukhoi design and used an illustration of the su-9 fishpot design edit the mig-21 was the first successful soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft it was a lightweight fighter achieving mach 2 with a relatively low-powered afterburning turbojet and is thus comparable to the american lockheed f-104 starfighter and northrop f-5 freedom fighter and the french dassault mirage iii 1 its basic layout was used for numerous other soviet designs delta-winged aircraft included su-9 interceptor and the fast e-150 prototype from mig bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter su-7 and mikoyans i-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings however the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the ussr and finally proved to have limited development potential mainly because of the very small space available for the radar like many aircraft designed as interceptors the mig-21 had a short range this was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity as the internal fuel was consumed the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters this had the effect of making the plane statically unstable to the point of being difficult to control resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition this can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity the chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout also second generation of soviet variants and also carry significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue 3 additionally when more than half the fuel was used up violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine questionable thereby causing it to shut down in flight this increased the risk of tank implosions mig-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engines compressor a problem inherited from the mig-15 mig-17 and mig-19 4 the short endurance and low fuel capacity of the mig-21f pf pfm ssm and mmf variantsthough each had a somewhat greater fuel capacity than its predecessorled to the development of the mt and smt variants these had an increased range of 250km 155mi compared to the mig-21sm but at the cost of worsening all other performance figures such as a lower service ceiling and slower time to altitude 1 the delta wing while excellent for a fast-climbing interceptor meant any form of turning combat led to a rapid loss of speed however the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a climb rate of 235ms 46250ftmin was possible with a combat-loaded mig-21bis 1 not far short of the performance of the later f-16a given a skilled pilot and capable missiles it could give a good account of itself against contemporary fighters its g-limits were increased from 7gs in initial variants to 85gs in the latest variants 5 it was replaced by the newer variable-geometry mig-23 and mig-27 for ground support duties however not until the mig-29 would the soviet union ultimately replace the mig-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new american air superiority types the mig-21 was exported widely and remains in use the aircrafts simple controls engine weapons and avionics were typical of soviet-era military designs the use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the flight envelope enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots this in turn enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools while technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying eastern bloc military hardware several russian israeli and romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to mig-21 operators designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments 1 production edit a total of 10645 aircraft were built in the ussr they were produced in three factories az 30 n 1 3203 aircraft in moscow also known as mmz znamya truda gaz 21 5765 aircraft in gorky n 2 and taz 31 1678 aircraft in tbilisi generally gorky built single-seaters for the soviet forces moscow constructed single-seaters for export and tbilisi manufactured the twin-seaters both for export and the ussr though there were exceptions the mig-21r and mig-21bis for export and for the ussr were built in gorky 17 single-seaters were helmed in tbilisi mig-21 and mig-21f the mig-21mf was first constructed in moscow and then gorky and the mig-21u was built in moscow as well as in tbilisi 1 a total of 194 mig-21f-13s were built under licence in czechoslovakia and hindustan aeronautics ltd of india built 657 mig-21fl mig-21m and mig-21bis of which 225 were bis design edit the mig-21 has a delta wing the sweep angle on the leading edge is 57 with a tsagi s-12 airfoil the angle of incidence is 0 while the dihedral angle is 2 on the trailing edge there are ailerons with an area of 118m and flaps with an area of 187m in front of the ailerons there are small wing fences the fuselage is semi-monocoque with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of 124m 4ft 1in the air flow to the engine is regulated by an inlet cone in the air intake on early model mig-21s the cone has three positions for speeds up to mach 1.5 the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position for speeds between mach 1.5 and mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position for speeds higher than mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position on the later model mig-21pf the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed the cone position for a given speed is calculated by the uvd-2m system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine on both sides of the nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff in the first variant of the mig-21 the pitot tube is attached to the bottom of the nose after the mig-21p variant this tube is attached to the top of the air intake later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right as seen from the cockpit and had an emergency pitot head on the right side just ahead of the canopy and below the pilots eyeline the cabin is pressurized and air conditioned on variants prior to the mig-21pfm the cabin canopy is hinged at the front when ejecting the sk-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to make a capsule that encloses the pilot the capsule protects the pilot from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections after ejection the capsule opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground however ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate sometimes resulting in pilot death the minimum height for ejection in level flight was 110 m starting from the mig-21pfm the canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit on the under side of the aircraft there are three air brakes two at the front and one at the rear the front air brakes have an area of 076m and a deflection angle of 35 the rear air brake has an area of 046m and a deflection angle of 40 the rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear on the under side of the airplane just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two jato rockets the front section of the fuselage ends at former 28 the rear section of the fuselage starts at former 28a and is removable for engine maintenance the empennage of the mig-21 consists of a vertical stabilizer a stabilator and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control the vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60 and an area of 532m on earlier version 38m and a rudder the stabilator has a sweep angle of 57 an area of 394m and a span of 26m the mig-21 uses a tricycle type undercarriage on most variants the main landing gear uses tires that are 800mm in diameter and 200mm in width only the mig-21f variants use tires with the size 660x200mm the wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87 and the shock absorbers retract into the wing the nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar the nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit thus landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel ventral fuel tank or the airbrake operational history edit india edit overview edit india is the third largest operator of mig-21s behind russia and china in 1961 the indian air force iaf opted to purchase the mig-21 over several other western competitors as part of the deal the soviet union offered india full transfer of technology and rights for local assembly 6 in 1964 the mig-21 became the first supersonic fighter jet to enter service with the iaf due to limited induction numbers and lack of pilot training the iaf mig-21 played a limited role in the indo-pakistani war of 1965 7 however the iaf gained valuable experience while operating the mig-21 for defensive sorties during the war 7 the positive feedback from iaf pilots during the 1965 war prompted india to place more orders for the fighter jet and also invest heavily in building the mig-21s maintenance infrastructure and pilot training programs since 1963 india has introduced more than 1200 mig fighters into its air force as of august 2013 at least 252 mig-21s are known to be in operation however the plane has been plagued by safety problems since 1970 more than 170 indian pilots and 40 civilians have been killed in mig-21 accidents at least 14 mig-21s have crashed between 2010 and 2013 8 over half of the 840 aircraft built between 1966 and 1984 were lost to crashes 9 when in afterburner the engine operates very close to its surge line and the ingestion of even a small bird can lead to an engine surgeseizure and flame out on 11 december 2013 indias second generation supersonic jet fighter mig-21fl was decommissioned after being in service for 50 years 10 in view of the several incidents that have occurred after the 1999 kargil war the modernized mig-21 bison seems to have at present the role of an interceptor and possibly a limited role of a fighter aircraft 11 12 the remaining mig-21 bisons of the iaf are scheduled to be phased out by 2019 13 1971 india pakistan war edit the expansion of iaf mig-21 fleet marked a developing india-soviet union military partnership which enabled india to field a formidable air force to counter chinese and pakistani threats 14 the capabilities of the mig-21 were put to the test during the bangladesh liberation war during the war the mig-21s played a crucial role in giving the iaf air superiority over vital points and areas in the western theater of the conflict 15 the 1971 war witnessed the first supersonic air combat in the subcontinent when an indian mig-21fls claimed a paf f-104 starfighter with its gsh-23 twin-barrelled 23mm cannon 16 by the time the hostilities came to an end the iaf mig-21s had claimed four paf f-104s two paf shenyang f-6 one paf north american f-86 sabre and one paf lockheed c-130 hercules according to one western military analyst the mig-21s had clearly won the much anticipated air combat between the mig-21 and the f-104 starfighter 17 because of the formidable performance of the mig-21s several nations including iraq approached india for mig-21 pilot training by the early 1970s more than 120 iraqi pilots were being trained by the indian air force 18 kargil war and atlantique incident edit it was also used as late as 1999 in the kargil war in which one indian air force mig-21s was destroyed by ground fire 19 the mig-21s last known kill took place in 1999 during the atlantique incident when two mig-21 aircraft of the indian air force intercepted and shot down a breguet atlantique reconnaissance aircraft of the pakistani navy with the r-60mk aa-8 aphid air-to-air missile indonesia edit the indonesian air force purchased 22 mig-21s in 1962 20 mig-21f-13s and mig-21us were received during operation trikora in the western new guinea conflict indonesian mig-21s never fought in any dogfights right after the us backed anti-communist forces took over the government 13 indonesian mig-21s were delivered to the us in exchange for t-33 uh-34d and later f-5 and ov-10 aircraft all remaining mig-21s were grounded and retired due to lack of spare parts and the withdrawal of soviet maintenance support the migs were added to the 4477th test and evaluation squadron red eagles a usaf aggressor squadron at tonopah test range 21 vietnam edit as may be seen from its range figures the mig-21 was designed for very short ground-controlled interception gci missions it became renowned for this type of mission in the skies over north vietnam 22 the first mig-21s arrived directly from the soviet union by ship in april 1966 after being unloaded and assembled 23 they were given to north vietnams oldest fighter unit the 921st fighter regiment which had been created on 3 february 1964 as a mig-17 unit because the north vietnamese air forces 923rd fr was newer and less experienced they would continue to operate mig-17s while the arrival of the mig-19s j6 versions from china in 1969 would create north vietnams only mig-19 unit the 925th fr on 3 february 1972 north vietnam commissioned their fourth and last fighter regiment created during the war with the republic of vietnam the mig-21pfm type 94 equipped 927th fighter regiment 24 although 13 of north vietnams flying aces attained their status while flying the mig-21 cf three in the mig-17 many north vietnamese pilots preferred the mig-17 because the high wing loading of the mig-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the mig-17 gave better visibility 25 however this is not the impression perceived by british author roger boniface when he interviewed pham ngoc lan and ace nguyn nht chiu who scored victories flying both mig-17 and mig-21 26 27 pham ngoc lan told boniface that the mig-21 was much faster and it had two atoll missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1000 and 1200 yards 28 29 and chiu asserted that for me personally i preferred the mig-21 because it was superior in all specifications in climb speed and armament the atoll missile was very accurate and i scored four kills with the atoll in general combat conditions i was always confident of a kill over a f-4 phantom when flying a mig-21 30 31 although the mig-21 lacked the long-range radar missiles and heavy bomb load of its contemporary multi-mission us fighters with its rp-21 sapfir radar it proved a challenging adversary in the hands of experienced pilots especially when used in high-speed hit-and-run attacks under gci control mig-21 intercepts of republic f-105 thunderchief strike groups were effective in downing us aircraft or forcing them to jettison their bomb loads mig-21 aerial combat victories in the vietnam war 19661972 edit sources hobson 36 toperczer 37 the north vietnamese flew their interceptors with guidance from ground controllers who positioned the migs in ambush battle stations to make their one pass then haul ass attacks 41 the migs made fast and often accurate attacks against us formations from several directions usually the mig-17s performed head-on attacks and the mig-21s attacked from the rear after shooting down a few american planes and forcing some of the f-105s to drop their bombs prematurely the migs did not wait for retaliation but disengaged rapidly these guerrilla warfare in the air tactics 41 generally proved successful during the course of the war in december 1966 the mig-21 pilots of the 921st fr downed 14 f-105s without any losses 42 the us air force and the us navy continued to lay down great expectations on the f4 phantom assuming that the massive firepower the best available on-board radar the highest speed and acceleration properties coupled with new tactics would provide phantoms with an advantage over the migs but in confrontations with the lighter mig-21 f-4s began to suffer losses from may to december 1966 the us air forces lost 47 aircraft destroying only 12 nvaf fighters in return from april 1965 to november 1968 over 268 air battles occurred over the skies of north vietnam north vietnam claimed 244 downed us aircraft while admitting to the loss of 85 migs 43 after a million sorties and nearly 1000 us aircraft losses operation rolling thunder came to an end on 1 november 1968 44 a poor air-to-air combat loss-exchange ratios against the smaller more agile enemy migs during the early part of the vietnam war eventually led the usn to create their navy fighter weapons school also known as topgun at naval air station miramar california on 3 march 1969 45 the usaf quickly followed with their own version titled the dissimilar air combat training sometimes referred to as red flag program at nellis air force base nevada these two programs employed the subsonic douglas a-4 skyhawk and the supersonic f-5 tiger ii as well as the mach 24-capable usaf convair f-106 delta dart which mimicked the mig-21 46 the culmination of the struggle in the air in early 1972 was may 10 when the vpafs aircraft completed 64 sorties resulting in 15 air battles vpaf claimed 7 f-4s were shot down us confirmed five f-4s were lost 47 those in turn managed to kill two mig-21s three mig-17s and one mig-19 may 11 two mig-21s who played the role of bait brought the four f-4s to 2 mig-21s circling at low altitude the migs quickly stormed the phantoms and 3 missiles shot down two f-4s june 13 a mig-21 unit intercepted a group of f-4s the second pair of migs made a missile attack and were hit by two f-4s may 18 vietnamese aircraft made 26 sorties eight of which resulted in combat costing four f-4 phantoms while the vietnamese fighters on that day did not suffer any losses over the course of the air war between 3 april 1965 48 and 8 january 1973 each side would ultimately claim favorable kill ratios in 1972 the tally between american and vietnamese planes stood at 201 air battles the vpaf lost 54 migs including 36 mig-21s and one mig-21us and they claimed 90 us aircraft were shot down including 73 f-4 fighters and two spy rf-4c one mig-21 was shot down on 21 february 1972 by a us air force f-4 phantom piloted by major lodge with 1st lt roger locher as his wso based at udorn rtafb thailand this was claimed to be the first ever us air force mig kill at night and the first in four years at that time the intercept occurred near the fishs mouth region of the laos north vietnam border citation needed two mig-21s were claimed shot down by us air force boeing b-52 stratofortress tail gunners the only confirmed air-to-air kills made by the b-52 the first aerial victory occurred on 18 december 1972 kill awarded to tail gunner ssgt samuel turner who was awarded the silver star 49 the second air-to-air kill took place on 24 december 1972 kill awarded to a1c albert e moore for downing a mig-21 over the thai nguyen railroad yards both actions occurred during operation linebacker ii also known as the christmas bombings 50 these air-to-air kills were not confirmed by vpaf the biggest threat to north vietnam during the war had always been the strategic air command s b-52 stratofortress hanoi s mig-17 and mig-19 interceptors could not deal with those bombers at their flying altitude in the summer of 1972 the nvaf was directed to train 12 mig-21 pilots for the specific mission of attacking and shooting down b-52 bombers with two-thirds of those pilots specifically trained in the night attack 51 on 26 december 1972 just two days after tail gunner albert moore downed his mig-21 a vpaf north vietnamese air force mig-21mf number 5121 52 from the 921st fighter regiment flown by major phm tun over hanoi north vietnam claimed responsibility for the first aerial combat kill of a us air force boeing b-52 stratofortress in aviation history 53 the stratofortress had been above hanoi at over 30000 feet 9100m during operation linebacker ii when major tun launched two atoll missiles from 2 kilometres claiming to have destroyed one of the bombers flying in the three plane formation 53 other sources argue that his missiles failed to hit their mark but as he was disengaging a b-52 from a three-bomber cell in front of his target took a hit from a sam exploding in mid-air this may have caused tun to think his missiles destroyed the target he had been aiming for 54 the vietnamese side also claims another kill to have taken place on 28 december 1972 by a mig-21 from the 921st fr this time flown by vu xuan thieu thieu is said to have perished in the explosion of a b-52 hit by his own missiles having approached the target too closely 55 in this case the vietnamese version appears to be erroneous while one mig-21 kill was claimed by phantoms that night this may have been thieus mig no b-52s were lost to any cause on the date of the claimed kill 56 year-by-year kill claims involving mig-21s 1 1966 us claimed

bombers soviet general fesenko the main soviet adviser to the north vietnamese air force in 1972 55 recorded 34 mig-21s destroyed in 1972 55 during the vietnam war the vpaf claimed 103 f-4 phantoms were shot down by mig-21s 57 and they lost 60 mig-21s in air combat 1 in late 2015 the vpaf announced that they would gradually phase out the mig-21 in favor of the su-22m4 su-27sk and su-30mk2v citation needed egyptiansyrianisraeli conflicts edit the mig-21 was also used extensively in the middle east conflicts of the 1960s 1970s and 1980s by the egyptian air force syrian air force and iraqi air force the mig-21 first encountered israeli mirage iii cs on 14 november 1964 but it was not until 14 july 1966 that the first mig-21 was shot down another six syrian mig-21s were shot down by israeli mirages on 7 april 1967 mig-21s also faced mcdonnell douglas f-4 phantom iis and douglas a-4 skyhawks but were later outclassed by the more modern mcdonnell douglas f-15 eagle and general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon which were acquired by israel beginning in the mid-1970s during the opening attacks of the 1967 six-day war the israeli air force struck arab air forces in four attack waves in the first wave idf aircraft claimed to have destroyed eight egyptian aircraft in air-to-air combat of which seven were mig-21s egypt claimed five kills scored by mig-21pfs 58 during the second wave israel claimed four mig-21s downed in air-to-air combat and the third wave resulted in two syrian and one iraqi mig-21s claimed destroyed in the air the fourth wave destroyed many more syrian mig-21s on the ground overall egypt lost around 100 out of about 110 mig-21s they had almost all on the ground syria lost 35 of 60 mig-21f-13s and mig-21pfs in the air and on the ground 1 between the end of the six-day war and the start of the war of attrition idf mirage fighters had six confirmed kills of egyptian mig-21s in exchange for egyptian mig-21s scoring two confirmed and three probable kills against israeli aircraft during the war of attrition itself israel claimed 56 confirmed kills citation needed against egyptian mig-21s while egyptian mig-21s claimed 14 confirmed and 12 probable kills against idf aircraft during this same time period from the end of the six day war to the end of the war of attrition israel claimed a total of 25 syrian mig-21s destroyed the syrians claimed three confirmed and four probable kills of israel aircraft although israel denied these 1 high losses to egyptian aircraft and continuous bombing during the war of attrition caused egypt to ask the soviet union for help in june 1970 soviet pilots and sam crews arrived with their equipment on 22 june 1970 a soviet pilot flying a mig-21mf shot down an israeli a-4e after some more successful intercepts by soviet pilots and another israeli a-4 being shot down on 25 july israel decided to plan an ambush in response on 30 july israeli f-4s lured soviet mig-21s into an area where they were ambushed by mirages asher snir flying a mirage iiicj destroyed a soviet mig-21 avihu ben-nun and aviam sela both piloting f-4es each got a kill and an unidentified pilot in another mirage scored the fourth kill against the soviet-flown mig-21s three soviet pilots were killed and the soviet union was alarmed by the losses however soviet mig-21 pilots and sam crews destroyed a total of 2 israeli aircraft which helped to convince the israelis to sign a ceasefire agreement in september 1973 a large air battle erupted between syria and israel israel claimed a total of 12 syrian mig-21s destroyed while syria claimed eight kills scored by mig-21s and admitted five losses during the yom kippur war israel claimed 73 kills against egyptian mig-21s 65 confirmed egypt claimed 27 confirmed kills against israeli aircraft by its mig-21s plus eight probables 1 however according to most israeli sources these were exaggerated claims as israeli air-to-air combat losses for the entire war did not exceed five to fifteen 59 60 on the syrian front of the war 6 october 1973 saw a flight of syrian mig-21mfs shoot down an idf a-4e and a mirage iiicj while losing three of their own to israeli iai neshers on 7 october syrian mig-21mfs downed two israeli f-4es three mirage iiicjs and an a-4e while losing two of their migs to neshers and one to an f-4e plus two to friendly sam fire iraqi mig-21pfs also operated on this front and on that same day destroyed two a-4es while losing one mig on 8 october 1973 syrian mig-21pfms downed three f-4es but six of their mig-21s were lost by the end of the war syrian mig-21s claimed a total of 30 confirmed kills against israeli aircraft 29 mig-21s were claimed 26 confirmed as destroyed by the idf 1 between the end of the yom kippur war and the start of the 1982 lebanon war israel had received modern f-15s and f-16s which were far superior to the old syrian mig-21mfs according to the idf these new aircraft accounted for the destruction of 24 syrian mig-21s over this time period though syria did claim five kills against idf aircraft with their mig-21s armed with outdated k-13 missiles although israel denied they suffered any losses 1 the 1982 lebanon war started on 6 june 1982 and in the course of that war the idf claimed to have destroyed about 45 syrian mig-21mfs syria claimed two confirmed and 15 probable kills of israeli aircraft 1 two israeli f-15 and one f-4 was damaged in combat with the mig-21 61 62 this air battle was the largest to occur since the korean war syrian civil war edit see also list of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the syrian civil war starting in july 2012 after more than a year of the syrian civil war had seen no aerial action the syrian air force started operations against syrian insurgents mig-21s were among the first combat ready aircraft used in bombings rocket attacks and strafing runs with many videos recorded from the ground showing the jets in combat 63 the rebels had access to heavy machine guns different antiaircraft guns and chinese manpads up to modern designs such as the fn-6 the first loss of a mig-21 was recorded on 30 august 2012 its registration was 2271 it was likely downed on take off or landing at abu al-duhur military airbase under siege by rebels by heavy machine gun fire 64 a few days later a second mig-21 registered 2280 was shot down and recorded on video on 4 september 2012 it was likely downed on take off or landing at abu dhuhur air base under siege by rebels by kpv 145mm machine gun fire 65 on 10 november 2014 a syrian air force mig-21bis serialed 2204 was shot down by rebels either using a manpads or antiaircraft guns near sabboura town 45km east of hama airbase where it was likely based the pilot was killed video and picture evidence of the crash site surfaced 66 67 after four months during which the syrian air force suffered no losses to enemy fire the last being a mig-23 on 12 march 2016 a syrian mig-21 was shot down by jaysh al-nasr over hama near kafr nabudah there were conflicting accounts of how it was brought down the syrian observatory for human rights reported the warplane had been downed by two manpads while jaysh al-nasr militants say they shot it down with anti-aircraft guns 68 video evidence suggesting it was a manpads it seems the pilot ejected but died either killed by ground fire while descending or other causes 69 other middle east conflicts edit egypt was shipped some american sidewinder missiles and these were fitted to their mig-21s and successfully used in combat against libyan mirages and mig-23s during the brief libyan-egyptian war of july 1977 iraniraq war edit during the iraniraq war 23 iraqi mig-21s were shot down by iranian f-14s confirmed by the iranian western and iraqi sources 70 and 29 mig-21s by f-4s 71 however from 1980 to 1988 the iraqi mig-21s shot down 43 iranian fighter aircraft against 49 mig-21 losses in the same period 72 libya edit libyan mig-21s saw limited service during the 2011 libyan civil war 73 on 15 march 2011 one mig-21bis and one mig-21um flown by defector libyan air force pilots who joined the rebellion flew from ghardabiya ab near sirte and landed at

crashed in tobruk due to pilot error during a pull up maneuver 75 it is unclear whether the pilot had been on a bombing mission in derna further east or had been performing an aerial ceremony for a pilot who died several days earlier 76 mig-21s under the control of the libyan house of representatives have been used extensively to bomb forces loyal to the rival general national congress in benghazi during the 2014 libyan civil war 77 78 horn of africa edit during the ogaden war of 197778 ethiopian air force f-5as engaged somali air force mig-21mfs in combat on several occasions in one lopsided incident two f-5as piloted by israeli advisers or mercenaries engaged four mig-21mfs the migs were handled incompetently by the somali pilots and the f-5as destroyed two while the surviving pilots collided with each other avoiding an aim-9 1 79 ethiopia claimed to have shot down 10 somali mig-21mfs while somalia also claimed to have destroyed several ethiopian mig-21mfs three f-5es one canberra bomber and three douglas dc-3s 1 ethiopian mig-21s were deployed largely in the ground attack role and proved instrumental during the final offensive against somali ground forces 1 angola edit during angola s long-running civil war mig-21s of the cuban air force were frequently deployed to attack ground targets manned by rebel forces or engage south african air force mirage f1s conducting cross-border strikes most mig-21 losses over angola were attributed to accurate ground fire such as an example downed by national union for the total independence of angola unita insurgents near luena with an american fim-92 stinger 80 despite extensive losses to man-portable air-defense systems mig-21s were instrumental during the battle of cuito cuanavale cuban pilots became accustomed to flying up to three sorties a day both the mig-21mf and the mig-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighterbomber role as interceptors they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying south african aircraft 81 on november 6 1981 a mirage f1cz achieved south africas first confirmed air-to-air kill since the korean war when it destroyed cuban lieutenant danacio valdezs mig-21mf with 30mm cannon fire 82 on 5 october 1982 mirages escorting an english electric canberra on routine reconnaissance over cahama were engaged by at least two mig-21bis a south african radar operator picked up the attacking migs and was able to alert the mirage pilots in advance instructing them to change course immediately as they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks however they were pinpointed by the cubans who opened pursuit in a vicious dogfight saaf major johann rankin closed range and maneuvered into the migs rear cones from there one of his two r550 magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead mig and forced it down the second aircraft piloted by a lieutenant raciel marrero rodriguez could not detect the mirages proximity until it had entered his turn radius and was perforated by rankins autocannon this damaged mig-21 landed safely at lubango 82 contacts between mig-21s and saaf mirage f1s or mirage iiis became increasingly common throughout the 1980s between 1984 and 1988 thirteen mig-21s were lost over angola 83 on 9 august 1984 a particularly catastrophic accident occurred when the 9th fighter training squadrons and the 12th fighter squadrons of the cuban air force attempted to carry out an exercise in poor weather a single mig-21bis and three mig-23s were lost 81 on 14 december 1988 an angolan air force mig-21bis strayed off course and executed an emergency landing in namibia where it was seized by local authorities since angola did not request its return after the south african border war the mig was restored by atlas

croatia and bosnia and herzegovina were relocated to air bases in serbia detailed records show at least seven mig-21s were shot down by aa defenses in croatia and bosnia 86 a mig-21 shot down an ec helicopter in 1992 87 croatia acquired three mig-21s in 1992 through defections by croatian pilots serving with the jna two of which were lost in subsequent actions one to serbian air defenses the other in a friendly fire accident 88 in 1993 croatia purchased about 40 mig-21s in violation of an arms embargo 88 but only about 20 of these entered service while the rest were used for spare parts croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations flash during which one was lost and storm the only air-to-air action for croatian migs was an attempt by two of them to intercept soko j-22 oraos of republika srpska air force on ground attack mission on august 7 1995 after some maneuvering both sides disengaged without firing 88 remaining yugoslav
