an ancient city at the location of modern sart sartmahmut before 19 october 2005 in turkey s manisa province sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia 1 one of the important cities of the persian empire the seat of a proconsul under the roman empire and the metropolis of the province lydia in later roman and byzantine times as one of the seven churches of asia it was addressed by john the author of the book of revelation in the bible in terms which seem to imply that its population was notoriously soft and fainthearted its importance was due first to its military strength secondly to its situation on an important highway leading from the interior to the aegean coast and thirdly to its commanding the wide and fertile plain of the hermus geography edit sardis was situated in the middle of hermus valley at the foot of mount tmolus a steep and lofty spur which formed the citadel it was about 4 kilometres 25mi south of the hermus today the site is located by the present day village of sart near salihli in the manisa province of turkey close to the ankara zmir highway approximately 72 kilometres 45mi from zmir the part of remains including the bath-gymnasium complex synagogue and byzantine shops is open to visitors year-round history edit see also lydia satrapy the greek historian and father of history herodotus notes that the city was founded by the sons of hercules the heraclidesthe earliest reference to sardis is in the persians of aeschylus 472bc in the iliad the name hyde seems to be given to the city of the maeonian ie lydian chiefs and in later times hyde was said to be the older name of sardis or the name of its citadel it is however more probable that sardis was not the original capital of the maeonians but that it became so amid the changes which produced the powerful lydian empire of the 8th century bc the city was captured by the cimmerians in the 7th century bc by the persians in the 6th by the athenians in the 5th and by antiochus iii the great at the end of the 3rd century bc in the persian era sardis was conquered by cyrus the great and formed the end station for the persian royal road which began in persepolis capital of persia during the ionian revolt the athenians burnt down the city sardis remained under persian domination until it surrendered to alexander the great in 334bc the early lydian kingdom was very advanced in the industrial arts and sardis was the chief seat of its manufactures the most important of these trades was the manufacture and dyeing of delicate woolen stuffs and carpets the stream pactolus which flowed through the market-place carried golden sands in early antiquity which was in reality gold dust out of mount tmolus it was during the reign of king croesus that the metallurgists of sardis discovered the secret of separating gold from silver thereby producing both metals of a purity never known before 2 this was an economic revolution for while gold nuggets panned or mined were used as currency their purity was always suspect and a hindrance to trade such nuggets or coinage were naturally occurring alloys of gold and silver known as electrum and one could never know how much of it was gold and how much was silver sardis now could mint nearly pure silver and gold coins the value of which could be and was trusted throughout the known world this revolution made sardis rich and croesus name synonymous with wealth itself for this reason sardis is famed in history as the place where modern currency was invented disaster came to the great city under the reign of the emperor tiberius when in ad 17 sardis was destroyed by an earthquake but it was rebuilt with the help of ten million sesterces from the emperor and exempted from paying taxes for five years 3 it was one of the great cities of western asia minor until the later byzantine period later trade and the organization of commerce continued to be sources of great wealth after constantinople became the capital of the east a new road system grew up connecting the provinces with the capital sardis then lay rather apart from the great lines of communication and lost some of its importance it still however retained its titular supremacy and continued to be the seat of the metropolitan bishop of the province of lydia formed in ad 295 it was enumerated as third after ephesus and smyrna in the list of cities of the thracesion thema given by constantine porphyrogenitus in the 10th century however over the next four centuries it was in the shadow of the provinces of magnesia-upon-sipylum and philadelphia which retained their importance in the region after 1071 the hermus valley began to suffer from the inroads of the seljuk turks but the byzantine general john doukas reconquered the city in 1097 the successes of the general philokales in 1118 relieved the district from later turkish pressure and the ability of the comneni dynasty together with the gradual decay of the seljuk sultanate of rum meant that it remained under byzantine dominion when constantinople was taken by the venetians and franks in 1204 sardis came under the rule of the byzantine empire of nicea however once the byzantines retook constantinople in 1261 sardis with the entire asia minor was neglected and the region eventually fell under the control of ghazi ghazw emirs the cayster valleys and a fort on the citadel of sardis was handed over to them by treaty in 1306 the city continued its decline until its capture and probable destruction by the turco-mongol warlord

synagogue in the western diaspora yet discovered from antiquity yielding over eighty greek and seven hebrew inscriptions as well as numerous mosaic floors for evidence in the east see dura europos in syria the discovery of the sardis synagogue has reversed previous assumptions about judaism in the later roman empire along with the discovery of the godfearers theosebeis inscription from aphrodisias

christianity had eclipsed judaism citation needed the synagogue was a section of a large bath-gymnasium complex that was in use for about 450 500years in the beginning middle of the 2nd century ad the
