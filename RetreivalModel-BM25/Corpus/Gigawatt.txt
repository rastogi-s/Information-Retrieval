watt wikipedia watt this article is about the unit of power for other uses see watt disambiguation the watt symbol w is a unit of power in the international system of units si it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second 1 and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer in dimensional analysis it is described by examples edit when an objects velocity is held constant at one meter per second against a constant opposing force of one newton the rate at which work is done is 1 watt in terms of electromagnetism one watt is the rate at which electrical work is performed when a current of one ampere a flows across an electrical potential difference of one volt v two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and ohms law where ohm is the si derived unit of electrical resistance a person having a mass of 100 kilograms who climbs a 3-meter-high ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts mass times acceleration due to gravity times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the rate of doing work or power i a laborer over the course of an 8-hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes 2 origin and adoption as an si unit edit the watt is named after the scottish inventor james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine the measurement unit was recognized by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in 1882 concurrent with the start of commercial power production from both water and steam in 1960 the 11th general conference on weights and measures adopted it for the measurement of power into the international system of units si multiples edit for additional examples of magnitude for multiples and submultiples of the watt see orders of magnitude power attowatt edit the attowatt aw is equal to 10 18 watt the sound intensity in water corresponding to the international standard reference sound pressure of 1 pa is approximately 0.65 awm 2 3 femtowatt edit the femtowatt fw is equal to one quadrillionth 10 15 of a watt technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in references to radio and radar receivers for example meaningful fm tuner performance figures for sensitivity quieting and signal-to-noise require that the rf energy applied to the antenna input be specified these input levels are often stated in dbf decibels referenced to 1 femtowatt this is 0.2739 microvolt across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load the specification takes into account the rf input impedance of the tuner picowatt edit the picowatt pw not to be confused with the much larger petawatt pw is equal to one trillionth 10 12 of a watt technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy one picowatt is the international standard reference value of sound power when this quantity is expressed as a level in decibels 4 nanowatt edit the nanowatt nw is equal to one billionth 10 9 of a watt important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers microwatt edit the microwatt w is equal to one millionth 10 6 of a watt important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the eeg and the ecg in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts 5 milliwatt edit the milliwatt mw is equal to one thousandth 10 3 of a watt a typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt 6 audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dbm referenced to one milliwatt kilowatt edit kilowatt and kilowatts redirect here for the place in the united states see kilowatt california for the musician james watts see kilowatts musician kw redirects here for other uses see kw disambiguation the kilowatt kw is equal to one thousand 10 3 watts this unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors tools machines and heaters it is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters one kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34 horsepower a small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt the average electric power consumption of a household in the united states is about one kilowatt ii a surface area of one square meter on earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the sun the solar irradiance on a clear day at mid day close to the equator 8 megawatt edit the megawatt mw is equal to one million 10 6 watts many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale including large electric motors large warships such as aircraft carriers cruisers and submarines large server farms or data centers and some scientific research equipment such as supercolliders and the output pulses of very large lasers a large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat on railways modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6mw although some produce much more the eurostar for example uses more than 12mw while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produceuse 3 to 5mw us nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300mw 9 the earliest citing of the megawatt in the oxford english dictionary oed is a reference in the 1900 websters international dictionary of english language the oed also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 november 1947 article in the journal science 5062 gigawatt edit the gigawatt gw is equal to one billion 10 9 watts or 1 gigawatt 1000 megawatts this unit is often used for large power plants or power grids for example by the end of 2010 power shortages in chinas shanxi province were expected to increase to 56 gw 10 and the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 25.8 gw 11 the largest unit out of four of the belgian doel nuclear power station has a peak output of 1.04 gw 12 hvdc converters have been built with power ratings of up to 2gw 13 terawatt edit the terawatt tw is equal to one trillion 10 12 watts the total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts see primary energy the most powerful lasers from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts but only for nanosecond time frames the average lightning strike peaks at 1 terawatt but these strikes only last for 30 microseconds petawatt edit the petawatt pw is equal to one quadrillion 10 15 watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time scales on the order of picoseconds 10 12 s one such laser is the lawrence livermores nova laser which achieved a power output of 125pw 7015125000000000000 1.25 10 15 w by a process called chirped pulse amplification the duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5 ps 6987500000000000000 5 10 13 s giving a total energy of 600j 14 another example is the laser for fast ignition experiments lfex at the institute of laser engineering ile osaka university which achieved a power output of 2pw for a duration of approximately 1 ps 15 16 based on the average total solar irradiance 17 of 1366kwm 2 the total power of sunlight striking earths atmosphere is estimated at 174pw see solar constant conventions in the electric power industry edit in the electric power industry megawatt electrical mwe 18 or mw e 19 refers by convention to the electric power produced by a generator while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt 20 mwt mw t or mwth mw th refers to thermal power produced by the plant for example the embalse nuclear power plant in argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109mw t ie heat which creates steam to drive a turbine which generates 648mw e ie electricity other si prefixes are sometimes used for example gigawatt electrical gw e the international bureau of weights and measures which maintains the si-standard states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol ie p thermal 270w rather than p 270w th and so these units are non-si 21 in compliance with si the energy company dong energy uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit megajoule s for delivered heating power in a combined heat and power station such as avedre power station 22 when describing alternating current ac electricity another distinction is made between the watt and the volt-ampere while these units are equivalent for simple resistive circuits they differ when loads exhibit electrical reactance radio transmission edit main article effective radiated power radio stations usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts referring to the effective radiated power it refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions distinction between watts and watt-hours edit the terms power and energy are frequently confused power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units eg watts that represent energy per unit time for example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 w is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100 watt hours wh 01kilowatt hour or 360 kj this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 25hours or a 50-watt bulb for 2hours power stations are rated using units of power typically megawatts or gigawatts for example the three gorges dam is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts this reflects the maximum power output it can achieve at any point in time a power stations annual energy output however would be recorded using units of energy not power typically gigawatt hours major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period often a calendar year or financial year one terawatt hour of energy is equal to a sustained power delivery of one terawatt for one hour or approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year the watt second is a unit of energy equal to the joule one kilowatt hour is 3600000 watt seconds the watt second is used for example to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography although the term joule is generally employed citation needed while a watt per hour exists in principle as a unit of rate of change of power with time iii it is not correct to refer to a watt or watt hour as a watt per hour 23
