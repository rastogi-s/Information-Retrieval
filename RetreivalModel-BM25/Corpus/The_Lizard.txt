of debate as to whether helston was once a port albeit no actual records still exist 7 geomorphologists believe the bar was most likely formed by rising sea levels after the last ice age blocking the river and creating a barrier beach the beach is formed mostly of flint and the nearest source is found offshore under the drowned terraces of the former river that flowed between england and france and now under the english channel 8 the medieval port of helston was at gweek possibly from around 1260 onwards on the helford river which exported tin and copper helston was believed to be in

undersea cable although intended to land at falmouth the final landing point was porthcurno near lands end in 1900 guglielmo marconi stayed the housel bay hotel in his quest to locate a coastal radio station to receive signals from ships equipped with his apparatus he leased a plot in the wheat field adjoining the hotel where the lizard wireless telegraph station still stands today recently restored by the national trust it looks as it did in january 1901 when marconi received the distance record signals of 186 miles 299km from his transmitter station at niton isle of wight the lizard wireless station is the oldest marconi station to survive in its original state and is located to the west of the lloyds signal station in what appears to be a wooden hut on 12 december 1901 poldhu point was the site of the first trans atlantic wireless signal radio communication when marconi sent a signal to st johns newfoundland the technology is one of the key advances to the development of radio television satellites and the internet 17 a radar station called raf drytree was built during world war ii the site was later chosen for the telstar project in 1962 its rocky foundations clear atmosphere and extreme southerly location being uniquely suitable this became the goonhilly satellite earth station now owned by goonhilly earth station ltd some important developments in television satellite transmission were made at goonhilly station a wind farm exists near to the goonhilly station site geology edit main article geology of lizard known as the lizard complex the peninsulas geology is the best preserved example of an exposed ophiolite in the united kingdom an ophiolite is a suite of geological formations which represent a slice through a section of ocean crust including the upper level of the mantle thrust onto the continental crust the lizard formations comprise three main units the serpentinites the oceanic complex and the metamorphic basement 18 ecology edit several nature sites exist on the lizard peninsula predannack nature reserve mullion island goonhilly downs and the cornish seal sanctuary at gweek an area of the lizard covering 16.62 square kilometres 642sqmi is designated a national nature reserve because of its coastal grasslands and heaths and inland heaths 19 the peninsula contains 3 main sites of special scientific interest sssi both noted for their endangered insects and plants as well as their geology the first is east lizard heathlands sssi the second is caerthillian to kennack sssi and the third is west lizard sssi of which the important wetland hayle kimbro pool forms a part of 20 21 the area is also home to one of englands rarest breeding birds the cornish chough this species of corvid is distinctive due to its red beak and legs and haunting chee-aw call chough began breeding on lizard in 2002 following a concerted effort by the cornish chough project in conjunction with defra and the rspb the lizard contains some of the most specialised flora of any area in britain including many red data book plant species of particular note is the cornish heath erica vagans that occurs in abundance here but which is found nowhere else in britain there are more than 600 species of flowering plants on the lizard nearly a quarter of all uk species 22 the reason for this richness is partly because of the many different and unusual lizard rocks on the lizard peninsula but above all it is a coming together of multiple factors a very mild maritime climate but one prone to gales and salt winds waterlogged and boggy soils but ones that often parch and dry out in the summer soils of greatly contrasting fertility and ph and lastly mans influence any single factor taken on its own would influence the flora taken together they combine overlap and interact contrasting plant communities grow side-by-side in a mosaic that changes within a few metres but also changes markedly over time with the cycle of heath fires its not so much that conditions are ideal for growth but that there is such a variety of different difficult conditions each habitat with its own combination of factors attracts its own specialist plants 23 it is also one of the few places where the rare formicine ant formica exsecta the narrow-headed ant can be found portrayal in literature film and music edit daphne du maurier based many novels on this part of cornwall including frenchmans creek the lizard was featured on the bbc television programme seven natural wonders as one of the wonders of the south west and on the
