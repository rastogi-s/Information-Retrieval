vulcan hypothetical planet wikipedia vulcan hypothetical planet for the fictional planet in the star trek universe see vulcan star trek vulcan is a small hypothetical planet that was proposed to exist in an orbit between mercury and the sun attempting to explain peculiarities of mercurys orbit the 19th-century french mathematician urbain le verrier hypothesized that they were the result of another planet which he named vulcan a number of reputable investigators became involved in the search for vulcan but no such planet was ever found and the peculiarities in mercurys orbit have now been explained by albert einstein s theory of general relativity 2 searches of data gathered by nasas two stereo spacecraft have failed to find any vulcanoids that could have accounted for claimed observations of vulcan 3 it is doubtful that there are any vulcanoids larger than 5.7 kilometres 35mi in diameter 3 other than mercury asteroid 2007 eb 26 whose orbit has a semi-major axis of 0.55 au 82000000km 51000000mi has the smallest known semi-major axis of any known object orbiting the sun 4 argument for existence edit in 1840 franois arago the director of the paris observatory suggested to the french mathematician urbain le verrier that he work on the topic of the planet mercury s orbital motion around the sun the goal of this study was to construct a model based on sir isaac newton s laws of motion and gravitation by 1843 le verrier published his provisional theory on the subject which would be tested during a transit of mercury across the face of the sun in 1843 as it turned out predictions from le verriers theory failed to match the observations 5 le verrier renewed his work and in 1859 published a more thorough study of mercurys motion this was based on a series of meridian observations of the planet as well as 14 transits the rigor of this study meant that any differences from observation would be caused by some unknown factor indeed there still remained some discrepancy 5 during mercurys orbit its perihelion advances by a small amount each orbit technically called perihelion precession the phenomenon is predicted by classical mechanics but the observed value differed from the predicted value by the small amount of 43 arcseconds per century citation needed le verrier postulated that the excess precession could be explained by the presence of a small planet inside the orbit of mercury and he proposed the name vulcan for this object in roman mythology vulcan was the god of beneficial and hindering fire 6 including the fire of volcanoes making it an apt name for a planet so close to the sun le verriers recent success in discovering the planet neptune 7 using the same techniques lent veracity to his claim and astronomers around the world attempted to observe a new planet there but nothing was ever found search edit on 22 december 1859 le verrier received a letter from french physician and amateur astronomer edmond modeste lescarbault who claimed to have seen a transit of the hypothetical planet earlier in the year le verrier took the train to the village of orgres-en-beauce some 70 kilometres 43mi southwest of paris where lescarbault had built himself a small observatory le verrier arrived unannounced and proceeded to interrogate the man citation needed lescarbault described in detail how on 26 march 1859 he noticed a small black dot on the face of the sun 8 which he was studying with his modest 3.75 inches 95mm refractor thinking it to be a sunspot lescarbault was not at first surprised but after some time had passed he realized that it was moving having observed the transit of mercury in 1845 he guessed that what he was observing was another transit but of a previously undiscovered body he took some hasty measurements of its position and direction of motion and using an old clock and a pendulum with which he took his patients pulses he estimated the duration of the transit at 1 hour 17 minutes and 9 seconds le verrier was satisfied that lescarbault had seen the transit of a previously unknown planet on 2 january 1860 he announced the discovery of vulcan to a meeting of the acadmie des sciences in paris lescarbault for his part was awarded the lgion dhonneur and invited to appear before numerous learned societies 9 not everyone accepted the veracity of lescarbaults discovery however an eminent french astronomer emmanuel liais who was working for the brazilian government in rio de janeiro in 1859 claimed to have been studying the surface of the sun with a telescope twice as powerful as lescarbaults at the very moment that lescarbault said he observed his mysterious transit liais therefore was in a condition to deny in the most positive manner the passage of a planet over the sun at the time indicated 10 based on lescarbaults transit le verrier computed vulcans orbit it supposedly revolved about the sun in a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 21million kilometres 014au 13000000mi the period of revolution was 19 days and 17 hours and the orbit was inclined to the ecliptic by 12 degrees and 10 minutes an incredible degree of precision as seen from the earth vulcans greatest elongation from the sun was 8 degrees numerous reportsall of them unreliablebegan to reach le verrier from other amateurs who claimed to have seen unexplained transits some of these reports referred to observations made many years earlier and many could not be properly dated nevertheless le verrier continued to tinker with vulcans orbital parameters as each new reported sighting reached him he frequently announced dates of future vulcan transits and when these failed to materialize he tinkered with the parameters some more among the earlier alleged observers of vulcan capel lofft reported an opaque body traversing the suns disc on 6 january 1818 11 gruithuisen on 26 june 1819 reported seeing two small spotson the sun round black and unequal in size 12 pastorff on 23 october 1822 24 and 25 july 1823 six times in 1834 on 18 october 1836 1 november 1836 and on 16 february 1837 also claimed to have seen two spots the larger was 3 arcseconds across and the smaller 1.25 arcseconds 12 shortly after eight oclock on the morning of 29 january 1860 far russell and three other people in london saw an alleged transit of an intra-mercurial planet 13 an american observer richard covington many years later claimed to have seen a well-defined black spot progress across the suns disk around 1860 when he was stationed in washington territory 14 no observations of vulcan were made in 1861 then on the morning of 22 march 1862 between eight and nine oclock greenwich time another amateur astronomer a mr lummis of manchester england saw a transit his colleague whom he alerted also saw the event based on these two mens reports two french astronomers benjamin valz and rodolphe radau independently calculated the objects supposed orbital period with valz deriving a figure of 17 days and 13 hours and radau a figure of 19 days and 22 hours citation needed on 8 may 1865 another french astronomer aristide coumbary observed an unexpected transit from istanbul turkey 15 between 1866 and 1878 no reliable observations of the hypothetical planet were made then during the total solar eclipse of 29 july 1878 two experienced astronomers professor james craig watson the director of the ann arbor observatory in michigan and lewis swift an amateur from rochester new york both claimed to have seen a vulcan-type planet close to the sun watson observing from separation wyoming placed the planet about 2.5 degrees southwest of the sun and estimated its magnitude at 4.5 swift who was observing the eclipse from a location near denver colorado saw what he took to be an intra-mercurial planet about 3 degrees southwest of the sun he estimated its brightness to be the same as that of theta cancri a fifth-magnitude star which was also visible during totality about six or seven minutes from the planet theta cancri and the planet were very nearly in line with the centre of the sun watson and swift had reputations as excellent observers watson had already discovered more than twenty asteroids while swift had several comets named after him both described the colour of their hypothetical intra-mercurial planet as red watson reported that it had a definite diskunlike stars which appear in telescopes as mere points of lightand that its phase indicated that it was approaching superior conjunction citation needed for half a century or more many other observers tried to find the hypothetical vulcan many false alarms were triggered by round sunspots that closely resembled planets in transit during solar eclipses stars close to the sun were mistaken for planets at one point to reconcile different observations at least two intra-mercurial planets were postulated citation needed conclusion edit in 1877 le verrier died convinced to the end of having discovered another planet with the loss of its principal proponent however the search for vulcan abated after many years of searching astronomers were seriously doubting the planets existence in 1915 einstein s theory of relativity an entirely different approach to understanding gravity from classical mechanics solved the problem 2 his equations predicted exactly the observed amount of advance of mercurys perihelion without any recourse to the existence of a hypothetical vulcan the new theory modified the predicted orbits of all planets but the magnitude of the differences from newtonian theory diminishes rapidly as one gets farther from the sun also mercurys fairly eccentric orbit makes it much easier to detect the perihelion shift than is the case for the nearly circular orbits of venus and earth vulcanoids edit main article vulcanoid observing a planet inside the orbit of mercury is difficult since the telescope must be pointed very close to the sun where the sky is only dark during a solar eclipse also an error in pointing the telescope can result in damage for the optics and injury to the observer if viewing directly the huge amount of light present even quite far away from the sun can produce false reflections inside the optics thus fooling the observer into seeing things that do not exist the best observational strategy might be to monitor the suns disk for possible transits but transits would only be seen from earth provided the object orbits close enough to the ecliptic plane a small dark spot might be seen to move across the suns disk as happens with transits of mercury and venus in 1915 when einstein successfully explained the apparent anomaly in mercurys orbit most astronomers abandoned the search for vulcan a few however remained convinced that not all the alleged observations of vulcan were unfounded among these was henry c courten of dowling college new york studying photographic plates of the 1970 eclipse of the sun he and his associates detected several objects which appeared to be in orbits close to the sun 16 even accounting for artifacts courten felt that at least seven of the objects were real courten believed that an intra-mercurial planetoid between 130 and 180 kilometres 80 and 110mi in diameter was orbiting the sun at a distance of about 01au 15000000km 9300000mi other images on his eclipse plates led him to postulate the existence of an asteroid belt between mercury and the sun none of these claims has ever been substantiated after more than forty years of observation it has been surmised that some of these objectsand other alleged intra-mercurial objectsmay exist being nothing more than previously unknown comets or small asteroids no such vulcanoid asteroids have been found and searches have ruled out any such asteroids larger than about 6km 37mi 3 neither soho nor stereo has detected a planet inside the orbit of mercury 3 17
