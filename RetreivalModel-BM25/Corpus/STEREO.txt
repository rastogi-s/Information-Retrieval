stereo wikipedia stereo stereo satellite redirects here for the musical ensemble see stereo satellite this article is about the nasa spacecraft for other uses of stereo see stereo disambiguation stereo solar terrestrial relations observatory is a solar observation mission 1 two nearly identical spacecraft were launched in 2006 into orbits around the sun that cause them to respectively pull farther ahead of and fall gradually behind the earth this enables stereoscopic imaging of the sun and solar phenomena such as coronal mass ejections mission profile edit the two stereo spacecraft were launched at 0052 utc on october 26 2006 from launch pad 17b at the cape canaveral air force station in florida on a delta ii 7925-10l launcher into highly elliptical geocentric orbits the apogee reached the moons orbit on december 15 2006 on the fifth orbit the pair swung by the moon for a gravity assist because the two spacecraft were in slightly different orbits the ahead a spacecraft was ejected to a heliocentric orbit inside earths orbit while the behind b spacecraft remained temporarily in a high earth orbit the b spacecraft encountered the moon again on the same orbital revolution on january 21 2007 being ejected from earth orbit in the opposite direction from spacecraft a spacecraft b entered a heliocentric orbit outside the earths orbit spacecraft a will take 347 days to complete one revolution of the sun and spacecraft b will take 387 days the a spacecraftsunearth angle will increase at 21.650 degreeyear the b spacecraftsunearth angle will change 21999 degrees per year given that the length of earths orbit is around 940 million kilometres both craft have an average speed in a rotating geocentric frame of reference in which the sun is always in the same direction of about 18kms but the speed varies considerably depending on how close they are to their respective aphelion or perihelion as well as on the position of earth their current locations are shown here over time the stereo spacecraft will continue to separate from each other at a combined rate of approximately 44 degrees per year there are no final positions for the spacecraft they achieved 90 degrees separation on january 24 2009 a condition known as quadrature this is of interest because the mass ejections seen from the side on the limb by one spacecraft can potentially be observed by the in situ particle experiments of the other spacecraft as they passed through earths lagrangian points l 4 and l 5 in late 2009 they searched for lagrangian trojan asteroids on february 6 2011 the two spacecraft were exactly 180 degrees apart from each other allowing the entire sun to be seen at once for the first time 2 even as the angle increases the addition of an earth-based view eg from the solar dynamics observatory will still provide full-sun observations for several years in 2015 contact was lost for several months when the stereo spacecraft passed behind the sun they will then start to approach earth again with closest approach sometime in 2023 they will not be recaptured into earth orbit 3 loss of contact edit on october 1 2014 contact was lost with stereo-b during a planned reset to test the crafts automation in anticipation of the aforementioned solar conjunction period the team originally thought the spacecraft had begun to spin decreasing the amount of power that could be generated by the solar panels 3 nasa used its deep space network first weekly and later monthly to try to re-establish communications 3 after a silence of 22 months contact was regained at 2227utc on august 21 2016 when the deep space network established a lock on stereo-b for 2.4 hours 4 5 6 later analysis of the received telemetry concluded that the spacecraft was in an uncontrolled spin of about three degrees per second this is too rapid to be immediately corrected using its reaction wheels which would become oversaturated 5 engineers will work to develop software to fix the spacecraft but once its computer is powered on there will only be about two minutes to upload the fix before stereo-b enters failure mode again 7 further while the spacecraft was power positive at the time of contact its orientation will drift and power levels will fall 5 as of 11october2016 update recovery attempts have been reduced until the spacecraft returns to a favorable orbit six attempts at communication between september 27 and october 9 failed and a carrier wave has not been detected since september 23 5 mission benefits edit the principal benefit of the mission is stereoscopic images of the sun in other words because the satellites are at different points along the earths orbit but distant from the earth they can photograph parts of the sun that are not visible from the earth this permits nasa scientists to directly monitor the far side of the sun instead of inferring the activity on the far side from data that can be gleaned from earths view of the sun the stereo satellites principally monitor the far side for coronal mass ejections massive bursts of solar wind solar plasma and magnetic fields that are sometimes ejected into space 8 since the radiation from coronal mass ejections or cmes can disrupt earths communications airlines power grids and satellites more accurate forecasting of cmes has the potential to provide greater warning to operators of these services 8 before stereo the detection of the sunspots that are associated with cmes on the far side of the sun was only possible using helioseismology which only provides low-resolution maps of the activity on the far side of the sun since the sun rotates every 25 days detail on the far side was invisible to earth for days at a time before stereo the period that the suns far side was previously invisible was a principal reason for the stereo mission 9 stereo program scientist madhulika guhathakurta expects great advances in theoretical solar physics and space weather forecasting with the advent of constant 360-degree views of the sun 10 stereos observations are already being incorporated into forecasts of solar activity for airlines power companies satellite operators and others 11 stereo has also been used to discover 122 eclipsing binaries and study hundreds more variable stars 12 stereo can look at the same star for up to 20 days 12 on july 23 2012 stereo-a was in the path of the solar storm of 2012 which was similar in strength to the carrington event 13 its instrumentation was able to collect and relay a significant amount of data about the event stereo-a was not harmed by the solar storm science instrumentation edit each of the spacecraft carries cameras particle experiments and radio detectors in four instrument packages sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation secchi has five cameras an extreme ultraviolet imager euvi and two white-light coronagraphs cor1 and cor2 these three telescopes are collectively known as the sun centered instrument package or scip and image the solar disk and the inner and outer corona two additional telescopes heliospheric imagers called the hi1 and hi2 image the space between sun and earth the purpose of secchi is to study the 3-d evolution of coronal mass ejections through their full journey from the suns surface through the corona and interplanetary medium to their impact at earth 14 15 in-situ measurements of particles and cme transients impact will study energetic particles the three-dimensional distribution of solar wind electrons and interplanetary magnetic field 14 16 plasma and suprathermal ion composition plastic will study the plasma characteristics of protons alpha particles and heavy ions 14 stereowaves swaves is a radio burst tracker that will study radio disturbances traveling from the sun to the orbit of earth 14 spacecraft subsystems edit each stereo spacecraft had a dry mass of 547kg 1206lb and a launch mass of 619kg 1364lb in their stowed configuration each had a length width and height of 201211m 667400375ft upon solar array deployment its width increased to 65m 2124ft 17 18 with all of its instrument booms and antennae deployed its dimensions are 758759m 245286192ft 19 the solar panels can produce an average of 596 watts of power and the spacecraft consumes an average of 475 watts 17 18 the stereo spacecraft are 3-axis stabilized and each has a primary and backup miniature inertial measurement unit mimu provided by honeywell 20 these measure changes to a spacecrafts attitude and each mimu contains three ring laser gyroscopes to detect angular changes additional attitude information is provided by the star tracker and the secchi guide telescope 21 stereos onboard computer systems are based on the integrated electronics module iem a device that combines core avionics in a single box each single-string spacecraft carries two cpus one for command-and-data handling and one for guidance and control both are radiation hardened 25 megahertz ibm rad6000 processors based on power1 cpus predecessor of the powerpc chip found in older macintoshes the computers slow by current personal computer standards are typical for the radiation requirements needed on the stereo mission stereo also carries actel fpgas that use triple modular redundancy for radiation hardening the fpgas hold the p24 misc and cpu24 soft microprocessors 22 for data storage each spacecraft carries a solid state recorder able to store up to one gigabyte each its main processor collects and stores on the recorder images and other data from stereos instruments which can then be sent back to earth the spacecraft have an x-band downlink capacity of between 427 and 750 kbps 17 18 gallery edit stereo probes stacked at astrotech in florida august 11 2006 launch
