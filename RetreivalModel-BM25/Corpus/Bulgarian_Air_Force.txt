general constantin popov history edit early years edit the bulgarian air force dates back to the end of the 19th century in 1892 at the plovdiv international fair two lieutenants of the bulgarian army flew in the la france balloon of the frenchman godard 1 later inspired by the flight they succeeded to convince the general staff that the bulgarian army should build a balloon force the imperial aviation school in st petersburg enrolled lieutenant vasil zlatarov as a student following numerous refusals from military schools around europe to teach bulgarian officers to use airships on 20 april 1906 vazduhoplavatelno otdelenie roughly translated as aviation squad was created to operate observation balloons for the army initially being a part of railway battalion 1 after graduation lt zlatarov was appointed its first commander after operating small balloons in 1911 a bigger godard balloon was bought and in 1912 the first balloon sofia-1 was constructed in bulgaria of materials bought from russia 1 in 1910 a russian aircraft engineer boris maslennikov was invited to bulgaria where he presented his airplane a modification of the french farman iii following his demonstration assisted by vasil zlatarov over the hippodrome in sofia the bulgarian government decided to acquire airplanes for the aviation corps in early 1912 thirteen army officers were sent abroad for training as pilots and orders were placed for five french british and german airplanes 1 the officers sent to france completed their training first and returned to bulgaria in july 1912 the same year bulgaria received its first airplane bleriot xxi with which on 13 august 1912 simeon petrov flew to become the first bulgarian to pilot an airplane over bulgaria 1 first and second balkan wars edit following the outbreak of the first balkan war bulgarian pilots still abroad hastily procured aircraft to be shipped home after them and foreign volunteer pilots converged from all over europe in bulgaria 2 after the front lines had stabilized an aeroplane platoon was established at a new airfield close to the fighting 2 intelligence about the turkish army strength and dispositions in the edirne was required and on 16 october 1912 two aviators performed a reconnaissance flight over the city in an albatros fiii biplane dropping also two bombs which was not only the first military mission performed by a bulgarian aircraft but also the first combat use of an aircraft in europe 1 later that month the bulgarian aviation corps was expanded to three aeroplane platoons foreign volunteers began flying operational sorties alongside bulgarian pilots and carried out reconnaissance leaflet-dropping and bombing missions during the war at least three aircraft were shot down considerable help was received from the russians in terms of aircraft maintenance and training due to low aircraft serviceability and frequent accidents the number of missions flown was relatively low despite that the bulgarian airmen and their foreign helpers were able to gather enough intelligence for the army general staff to use in the capture of the city although inflicting little physical damage the bombs had a devastating effect on the defending turkish garrisons morale and played a crucial part in the fall of the city which was until then considered nearly impregnable citation needed during the first balkan war bulgarian aviation undertook 70 combat sorties including 11 bombing raids during the second balkan war it undertook 6 sorties 1 all in all during both wars there were over 230 aircraft

beginning of the first world war training was held at list nordenhai and kiel in november 1915 a seaplane station under german control was established near varna initially operating four friedrichshafen ff-33 bombers and a rumpler 6b1 fighter later at the coast of the varna lake a second seaplane station was built this one under bulgarian control operating the same inventory near sozopol a forward fuel and ammunition replenishment base was established in support of patrol flights over the southern bulgarian coastline at the end of 1917 the german station was transferred to the bulgarian navy at the time of the armistice the bulgarian fleet air arm comprised two seaplane stations a forward replenishment base three hangars three workshops ammunition warehouses and 10 seaplanes after the cease-fire the machines were used for mine reconnaissance at the end of 1919 they are transported by train to bozhurishte airfield to be scrapped along with the army aviation inventory citation needed the bulgarian balloon observers also took part in the war they were most active on the dobrudzha front where aircraft activities were scarce a german bomber squadron flying missions against bucharest and constanaine gotha bombers accounted for the most flights near the bulgarian city of yambol an airship hangar was constructed to house german airships the airship schtte-lanz sl 10 was the first to use it according to documents of the time it was assigned to the bulgarian army but was actually under german control it was lost during a flight over the black sea in july 1916 in august 1916 the lz 101 replaced it after performing raids on targets in romania and greece it returned to germany in august 1917 in november 1917 the naval airship l 59 arrived that

27 1919 the treaty of neuilly-sur-seine was signed in accordance with the treaty the kingdom of bulgaria was banned from operating military aircraft under any form for the next 20 years for that reason all bulgarian airplanes balloons aviation equipment weaponry and ammunition were to be destroyed under allied control under the terms of the treaty any aircraft procured for civilian purposes

balloons 76 aviation machine guns a number of photographic cameras and other aviation equipment were destroyed at the military airfield of bozhurishte the seaplanes of the bulgarian navy were delivered by train to the same airfield and scrapped soon after that due to the devotion of the air troops personnel and the help of the population of the surrounding villages several aircraft were hidden thus evading allied inspection following destruction seven dfw cv albatros ciii and a single fokker dvii were among the survivors in addition at least ten aviation engines benz-iv and mercedes-iii were also saved citation needed the bulgarian government tried to get around the ban for military flight activity by establishing a gendarmery aeroplane section in 1919 since the gendarmery was at that time a service under the ministry of war the creation of the unit was met by fierce opposition by the allied commission this almost resulted in the destruction of the whole vrazhdebna airfield but the disbandment of the unit prevented this from happening citation needed an aeroflight section under the ministry of railways postal service and telegraph was created in 1920 bulgarian aviation personnel assembled two airplanes from hidden spares and parts salvaged from the destroyed military airplanes the two aircraft known as the mixed planes recorded about 1000 flight

c59 henriot xd14 bristol 29 tourer types avro 522 seaplanes were also procured during the same year the bulgarian airplane construction specialist atanas grigorov who obtained his qualification at the albatroswerke berlin assembled his seaplane called grigorov-1 the aircraft made several test-flights recording excellent characteristics but was damaged beyond repair by a storm in the hangar where it

bristol lucifer and the macchi 200018 flying boats boosting the countrys aircraft inventory the bulgarian government invited a group of german aircraft engineers headed by the constructor herr hermann winter to help establish an aviation factory named the states aeroconstruction atellir more popular as dar-bozhurishte the factory was initially managed by the first bulgarian pilot to achieve an aerial victory mr marko parvanov the first aircraft types produced by the plant were the uzounov-1 an indigenous variant of the wartime german dfw cv and the dar-2 indigenous variant of the german albatros ciii of the same era both types well-known and loved by the personnel of the former air troops and with bulgarian combat service experience a new type the dar-1 was also in a phase of development during the course of 1926 the airplane school was moved to the geographical center of the country the town of kazanlak was well suited for it stayed away from the allied control commission the czechoslovak aero-praha company also built an aircraft factory near that city but its models were not up to the requirements of the bulgarian authorities after an unsuccessful switch to automotive production the plant was finally sold to the italian caproni company the factory became popular as balgarski kaproni or bulgarian caproni the first examples of the very successful dar-1 were produced and entered service with the aeroflight directorate during 1926 citation needed the 1927 structure of the directorate was the following a fighter yato note 1 flying the dar-1s a bomber yato flying the
