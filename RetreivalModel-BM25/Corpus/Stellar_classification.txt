stellar classification wikipedia stellar classification hertzsprungrussell diagram spectral type brown dwarfs white dwarfs red dwarfs subdwarfs main sequence dwarfs subgiants giants bright giants supergiants hypergiants absolute magni tude m v in astronomy stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element the strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere although in some cases there are true abundance differences the spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state giving an objective measure of the photospheres temperature most stars are currently classified under the morgan-keenan mk system using the letters o b a f g k and m a sequence from the hottest o type to the coolest m type each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest eg a8 a9 f0 and f1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler the sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system such as class d for white dwarfs and classes s and c for carbon stars in the mk system a luminosity class is added to the spectral class using roman numerals this is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the stars spectrum which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs luminosity class 0 or ia is used for hypergiants class i for supergiants class ii for bright giants class iii for regular giants class iv for sub-giants class v for main-sequence stars class sd or vi for sub-dwarfs and class d or vii for white dwarfs the full spectral class for the sun is then g2v indicating a main-sequence star with a temperature around 5800k conventional color description edit main article green star astronomy the conventional color description takes into account only the peak of the stellar spectrum however in actuality stars radiate in all parts of the spectrum and because all spectral colors combined appear white the actual apparent colors the human eye would observe are far lighter than the conventional color descriptions would suggest this means that the simplified assignment of colors of the spectrum can be misleading excluding color-contrast illusions in dim light there are no green indigo or violet stars red dwarfs are a deep shade of orange and brown dwarfs do not literally appear brown but hypothetically would appear to be a dim grey to a nearby observer modern classification edit the modern classification system is known as the morgankeenan mk classification each star is assigned a spectral class from the older harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using roman numerals as explained below forming the stars spectral type other modern stellar classification systems such as the ubv system are based on color indexes the measured differences in three or more color magnitudes those numbers are given labels such as u-v or b-v which represent the colors passed by two standard filters eg u ltraviolet b lue and v isual harvard spectral classification edit the harvard system is a one-dimensional classification scheme by astronomer annie jump cannon who re-ordered and simplified a prior alphabetical system stars are grouped according to their spectral characteristics by single letters of the alphabet optionally with numeric subdivisions main-sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2000 to 50000 k whereas more-evolved stars can have temperatures above 100000k physically the classes indicate the temperature of the stars atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest the spectral classes o through m as well as other more specialized classes discussed later are subdivided by arabic numerals 09 where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class for example a0 denotes the hottest stars in classa and a9 denotes the coolest ones fractional numbers are allowed for example the star mu normae is classified as o97 10 the sun is classified as g2 11 conventional color descriptions are traditional in astronomy and represent colors relative to the mean color of an aclass star which is considered to be white the apparent color 5 descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye or with binoculars however most stars in the sky except the brightest ones appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body the fact that the harvard classification of a star indicated its surface or photospheric temperature or more precisely its effective temperature was not fully understood until after its development though by the time the first hertzsprungrussell diagram was formulated by 1914 this was generally suspected to be true 12 in the 1920s the bengali physicist meghnad saha derived a theory of ionization by extending well-known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms first he applied it to the solar chromosphere then to stellar spectra 13 the harvard astronomer cecilia helena payne later to become cecilia payne-gaposchkin then demonstrated that the o-b-a-f-g-k-m spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature 14 because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype such as b3 or a7 depends upon largely subjective estimates of the strengths of absorption features in stellar spectra as a result these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals yerkes spectral classification edit the yerkes spectral classification also called the mkk system from the authors initials is a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by william wilson morgan philip c keenan and edith kellman from yerkes observatory 16 this two-dimensional temperature and luminosity classification scheme is based on spectral lines sensitive to stellar temperature and surface gravity which is related to luminosity whilst the harvard classification is based on just surface temperature later in 1953 after some revisions of list of standard stars and classification criteria the scheme was named the morgankeenan classification or mk by william wilson morgan and philip c keenans initials 17 and this system remains the system in modern use today denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit greater pressure broadening of spectral lines the gravity and hence the pressure on the surface of a giant star is much lower than for a dwarf star because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass therefore differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum a number of different luminosity classes are distinguished as listed in the table below 18 marginal cases are allowed for example a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant or may be in between the subgiant and main-sequence classifications in these cases two special symbols are used a slash means that a star is either one class or the other a dash means that the star is in between the two classes for example a star classified as a3-4iiiiv would be in between spectral types a3 and a4 while being either a giant star or a subgiant sub-dwarf classes have also been used vi for sub-dwarfs stars slightly less luminous than the main sequence nominal luminosity classvii and sometimes higher numerals is now rarely used for white dwarf or hot sub-dwarf classes since the temperature-letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs spectral peculiarities edit additional nomenclature in the form of lower-case letters can follow the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum 28 for example 59 cygni is listed as spectral typeb15vnne 34 indicating a spectrum with the general classification b15v as well as very broad absorption lines and certain emission lines history edit the reason for the odd arrangement of letters in the harvard classification is historical having evolved from the earlier secchi classes and been progressively modified as understanding improved secchi classes edit during the 1860s and 1870s pioneering stellar spectroscopist angelo secchi created the secchi classes in order to classify observed spectra by 1866 he had developed three classes of stellar spectra shown in the table below 35 36 37 in the late 1890s this classification began to be superseded by the harvard classification which is discussed in the remainder of this article 38 39 40 the roman numerals used for secchi classes should not be confused with the completely unrelated roman numerals used for yerkes luminosity classes draper system edit in the 1880s the astronomer edward c pickering began to make a survey of stellar spectra at the harvard college observatory using the objective-prism method a first result of this work was the draper catalogue of stellar spectra published in 1890 williamina fleming classified most of the spectra in this catalogue the catalogue used a scheme in which the previously used secchi classes i to iv were subdivided into more specific classes given letters from a to n also the letters o p and q were used o for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines p for planetary nebulae and q for stars not fitting into any other class 43 44 harvard system edit in 1897 another worker at harvard antonia maury placed the orion subtype of secchi classi ahead of the remainder of secchi classi thus placing the modern typeb ahead of the modern typea she was the first to do so although she did not use lettered spectral types but rather a series of twenty-two types numbered from i to xxii 45 46 in 1901 annie jump cannon returned to the lettered types but dropped all letters except o b a f g k and m used in that order as well as p for planetary nebulae and q for some peculiar spectra she also used types such as b5a for stars halfway between types b and a f2g for stars one-fifth of the way from f to g and so on 47 48 finally by 1912 cannon had changed the types b a b5a f2g etc to b0 a0 b5 f2 etc 49 50 this is essentially the modern form of the harvard classification system a common mnemonic for remembering the order of the spectral type letters from hottest to coolest is oh be a fine guygirl kiss me mount wilson classes edit a luminosity classification known as the mount wilson system was used to distinguish between stars of different luminosities 51 52 53 this notation system is still sometimes seen on modern spectra 54 spectral types edit the stellar classification system is taxonomic based on type specimens similar to classification of species in biology the categories are defined by one or more standard stars for each category and sub-category with an associated description of the distinguishing features 55 early and late nomenclature edit stars are often referred to as early or late types early is a synonym for hotter while late is a synonym for cooler depending on the context early and late may be absolute or relative terms early as an absolute term would therefore refer to o or b and possibly a stars as a relative reference it relates to stars hotter than others such as early k being perhaps k0 k1 and k3 late is used in the same way with an unqualified use of the term indicating stars with spectral types such as k and m but it can also be used for stars that are cool relative to other stars as in using late g to refer to g7 g8 and g9 in the relative sense early means a lower arabic numeral following the class letter and late means a higher number this obscure terminology is a hold-over from an early 20thcentury model of stellar evolution which supposed that stars were powered by gravitational contraction via the kelvinhelmholtz mechanism which is now known to not apply to main sequence stars if that were true then stars would start their lives as very hot early-type stars and then gradually cool down into late-type stars this mechanism provided ages of the sun that were much smaller than what is observed in the geologic record and was rendered obsolete by the discovery that stars are powered by nuclear fusion 56 the terms early and late were carried over beyond the demise of the model they were based on class o edit main article o-type star see also o-type main-sequence star blue giant and blue supergiant o-type stars are very hot and extremely luminous with most of their radiated output in the ultraviolet range these are the rarest of all main-sequence stars about 1 in 3000000 0.00003 of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are o-type stars nb 5 9 some of the most massive stars lie within this spectral class o-type stars frequently have complicated surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult o-type spectra formerly were defined by the ratio of the strength of the he ii 4541 relative to that of hei 4471 where is the wavelength measured in ngstrms spectral type o7 was defined to be the point at which the two intensities are equal with the hei line weakening towards earlier types typeo3 was by definition the point at which said line disappears altogether although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology due to this the modern definition uses the ratio of the nitrogen line niv 4058 to niii 4634-40-42 57 o-type stars have dominant lines of absorption and sometimes emission for he ii lines prominent ionized si iv o iii n iii and c iii and neutral helium lines strengthening from o5 to o9 and prominent hydrogen balmer lines although not as strong as in later types because they are so massive o-type stars have very hot cores and burn through their hydrogen fuel very quickly so they are the first stars to leave the main sequence when the mkk classification scheme was first described in 1943 the only subtypes of classo used were o5 to o95 58 the mkk scheme was extended to o97 in 1971 59 and o4 in 1978 60 and new classification schemes that add types o2 o3 and o35 have subsequently been introduced 61 spectral standards 55 o7v s monocerotis o9v 10 lacertae class b edit see also b-type main-sequence star blue giant and blue supergiant b-type stars are very luminous and blue their spectra have neutral helium which are most prominent at the b2 subclass and moderate hydrogen lines as o and b-type stars are so energetic they only live for a relatively short time thus due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed apart from runaway stars the transition from classo to classb was originally defined to be the point at which the he ii 4541 disappears however with modern equipment the line is still apparent in the early b-type stars today for main-sequence stars the b-class is instead defined by the intensity of the hei violet spectrum with the maximum intensity corresponding to classb2 for supergiants lines of silicon are used instead the siiv 4089 and siiii 4552 lines are indicative of early b at mid b the intensity of the latter relative to that of siii 4128-30 is the defining characteristic while for late b it is the intensity of mgii 4481 relative to that of hei 4471 57 these stars tend to be found in their originating ob associations which are associated with giant molecular clouds the orion ob1 association occupies a large portion of a spiral arm of the milky way and contains many of the brighter stars of the constellation orion about 1 in 800 0.125 of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are b-type main-sequence stars nb 5 9 massive yet non supergiant entities known as bestars are main-sequence stars that notably have or had at some time one or more balmer lines in emission with the hydrogen related electromagnetic radiation series projected out by the stars being of particular interest be stars are generally thought to feature unusually strong stellar winds high surface temperatures and significant attrition of stellar mass as the objects rotate at a curiously rapid rate 62 objects known as be or be stars possess distinctive neutral or low ionisation emission lines that are

luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye unless under exceptional conditions the brightest known m-class main-sequence star is m0v lacaille 8760 with magnitude 6.6 the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5 and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found although most classm stars are red dwarfs most giants and some supergiants such as vy canis majoris antares and betelgeuse are also classm furthermore the larger hotter brown dwarfs are late classm usually in the range of m65 to m95 the spectrum of a classm star contains lines from oxide molecules in the visible spectrum especially tio and all neutral metals but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent tio bands can

spectra of some very hot and bluish stars exhibit marked emission lines from carbon or nitrogen or sometimes oxygen class w wolfrayet edit main article wolfrayet star classw or wr represents the wolfrayet stars notable for spectra lacking hydrogen lines instead their spectra are dominated by broad emission lines of highly ionized helium nitrogen carbon and sometimes oxygen they are thought to mostly be dying supergiants with their hydrogen layers blown away by stellar winds thereby directly exposing their hot helium shells classw is further divided into subclasses according to the relative strength of nitrogen and carbon emission lines in their spectra and outer layers 33 wr spectra range is listed below 68 69 wn 33 spectrum dominated by niii-v and hei-ii lines wne wn2 to wn5 with some

spectra 71 these are low-mass stars and to distinguish them from the massive wolf-rayet stars their spectra are enclosed in square brackets eg wc most of these show wc spectra some wo and very rarely wn the slash stars edit main article slash star the slash stars are o-type stars with wn-like lines in their spectra the name slash comes from their printed spectral type having a slash in it eg ofwnl 57 there is a secondary group found with this spectra a cooler intermediate group designated ofpewn9 57 these stars have also been referred to as wn10 or wn11 but that has become less popular with the realisation of the evolutionary difference from other wolfrayet stars recent discoveries of even rarer stars have extended the range of slash stars as far as o2-35if wn5-7 which are even hotter than the original slash stars 72 cool red and brown dwarf classes edit main articles brown dwarf and red dwarf the new spectral types l t and y were created to classify infrared spectra of cool stars this includes both red dwarfs and brown dwarfs that are very faint in the visible spectrum 73 brown dwarfs whose energy comes from gravitational attraction alone cool as they age and so progress to later spectral types brown dwarfs start their lives with m-type spectra and will cool through the l t and y spectral classes faster the less massive they are the highest-mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to y or even t dwarfs within the age of the universe because this leads to an unresolvable overlap between spectral types effective temperature and luminosity for some masses and ages of different l-t-y types no distinct temperature or luminosity values can be given 8 class l edit class l dwarfs get their designation because they are cooler than m stars and l is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to m some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs they are a very dark red in color and brightest in infrared their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra 74 75 76 due to low surface gravity in giant stars tio and vo bearing condensates never form thus l-type stars larger than dwarfs can never form in an isolated environment it may be possible for these l-type supergiants to form through stellar collisions however an example of which is v838 monocerotis while in the height of its luminous red nova eruption class t methane dwarfs edit classt dwarfs are cool brown dwarfs with surface temperatures between approximately 550 and 1300k 277 and 1027c 530 and 1880f their emission peaks in the infrared methane is prominent in their spectra 74 75 classest and l could be more common than all the other classes combined if recent research is accurate because brown dwarfs persist for so longa few times the age of the universein the absence of catastrophic collisions these smaller bodies can only increase in number study of the number of proplyds protoplanetary disks clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously conjectured it is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other the first one to form will become a protostar which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity stripping them of their gas the victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the l and t classes which are quite invisible to us class y edit see also sub-brown dwarf and substellar object brown dwarfs of spectral classy are cooler than those of spectral classt and have qualitatively different spectra from them a total of 17objects have been placed in classy as of august 2013 77 although such dwarfs have been modelled 78 and detected within forty light-years by the wide-field infrared survey explorer wise 66 79 80 81 82 there is no well-defined spectral sequence yet and no prototypes nevertheless several objects have been proposed as spectral classes y0 y1 and y2 83 the spectra of these prospective y objects display absorption around 1.55 micrometers 84 delorme et al have suggested that this feature is due to absorption from ammonia and that this should be taken as the indicative feature for the t-y transition 84 85 in fact this ammonia-absorption feature is the main criterion that has been adopted to define this class 83 however this feature is difficult to distinguish from absorption by water and methane 84 and other authors have stated that the assignment of class y0 is premature 86 the latest brown dwarf proposed for the y spectral type wise 18282650 is a y2dwarf with an effective temperature originally estimated around 300 k the temperature of the human body 79 80 87 parallax measurements have however since shown that its luminosity is inconsistent with it being colder than 400k the coolest y dwarf currently known is wise 08550714 with an approximate temperature of 250k 88 the mass range for ydwarfs is 925 jupiter masses but young objects might reach below one jupiter mass which means that y class objects straddle the 13jupiter mass deuterium fusion limit that marks the current iau division between brown dwarfs and planets 83 late giant carbon-star classes edit carbon-stars are stars whose spectra indicate production of carbona byproduct of triple-alpha helium fusion with increased carbon abundance and some parallel s-process heavy element production the spectra of these stars become increasingly deviant from the usual late spectral classesg k and m equivalent classes for carbon-rich stars are s and c the giants among those stars are presumed to produce this carbon themselves but some stars in this class are double stars whose odd atmosphere is suspected of having been transferred from a companion that is now a white dwarf when the companion was a carbon-star class c carbon stars edit main article carbon star originally classified as r and n stars these are also known as carbon stars these are red giants near the end of their lives in which there is an excess of carbon in the atmosphere the old r and n classes ran parallel to the normal classification system from roughly mid g to late m these have more recently been remapped into a unified carbon classifier c with n0 starting at roughly c6 another subset of cool carbon stars are the c-jtype stars which are characterized by the strong presence of molecules of 13 cn in addition to those of 12 cn 89 a few main-sequence carbon stars are known but the overwhelming majority of known carbon stars are giants or supergiants there are several subclasses c-r formerly its own class r representing the carbon star equivalent of late g to early k-type stars c-n formerly its own class representing the carbon star equivalent of late k to m-type stars c-j a subtype of cool c stars with a high content of 13 c c-h population ii analogues of the c-r stars c-hd hydrogen-deficient carbon stars similar to late g supergiants with ch and c 2 bands added class s edit main article s-type star classs stars form a continuum between classm stars and carbon stars those most similar to classm stars have strong zro absorption bands analogous to the tio bands of classm stars whereas those most similar to carbon stars have strong sodium d lines and weak c 2 bands 90 classs stars have excess amounts of zirconium and other elements produced by the s-process and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than classm or carbon stars like carbon stars nearly all known classs stars are asymptotic-giant-branch stars the spectral type is formed by the letters and a number between zero and ten this number corresponds to the temperature of the star and approximately follows the temperature scale used for classm giants the most common types are s3 to s5 the non-standard designation s10 has only been used for the star chi cygni when at an extreme minimum the basic classification is usually followed by an abundance indication following one of several schemes s25 s25 s2 zr4 ti2 or s25 a number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of zro and tio a number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen on a scale of 1 to 10 where a 0 would be an ms star intensities of zirconium and titanium may be indicated explicitly also occasionally seen is a number following an asterisk which represents the strength of the zro bands on a scale from 1 to 5 classes ms and sc intermediary carbon-related classes edit in between the m and s classes border cases are named ms stars in a similar way border cases between the s and c-n classes are named sc or cs the sequence m ms s sc c-n is hypothesized to be a sequence of increased carbon abundance with age for carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch white dwarf classifications edit main article white dwarf spectroscopy the classd for degenerate is the modern classification used for white dwarfs low-mass stars that are no longer undergoing nuclear fusion and have shrunk to planetary size slowly cooling down classd is further divided into spectral types da db dc do dq dx and dz the letters are not related to the letters used in the classification of other stars but instead indicate the composition of the white dwarfs visible outer layer or atmosphere the white dwarf types are as follows 91 92 da a hydrogen rich atmosphere or outer layer indicated by strong balmer hydrogen spectral lines db a helium rich atmosphere indicated by neutral helium hei spectral lines do a helium-rich atmosphere indicated by ionized helium heii spectral lines dq a carbon rich atmosphere indicated by atomic or molecular carbon lines dz a metal rich atmosphere indicated by metal spectral lines a merger of the obsolete white dwarf spectral types dg dk and dm dc no strong spectral lines indicating one of the above categories dx spectral lines are insufficiently clear to classify into one of the above categories the type is followed by a number giving the white dwarfs surface temperature this number is a rounded form of 50400 t eff where t eff is the effective surface temperature measured in kelvins originally this number was rounded to one of the digits 1 through 9 but more recently fractional values have started to be used as well as values below 1 and above 9 91 93 two or more of the type letters may be used to indicate a white dwarf that displays more than one of the spectral features above 91 extended white dwarf spectral types 91 dab a hydrogen and helium-rich white dwarf displaying neutral helium lines dao a hydrogen and helium-rich white dwarf displaying ionized helium lines daz a hydrogen-rich metallic white dwarf dbz a helium-rich metallic white dwarf a different set of spectral peculiarity symbols are used for white dwarfs than for other types of stars stellar remnants edit main articles neutron star black hole and exotic star stellar remnants are objects associated with the death of stars included in the category are white dwarfs and as can be seen from the radically different classification scheme for classd non-stellar objects are difficult to fit into the mk system the hertzsprung-russell diagram which the mk system is based on is observational in nature so these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram or cannot be placed at all old neutron stars are relatively small and cold and would fall on the far right side of the diagram planetary nebulae are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the white dwarf branch if shown a planetary nebula would be plotted to the right of the diagrams upper right quadrant a black hole emits no visible light of its own and therefore would not appear on the diagram 94 replaced spectral classes edit several spectral types all previously used for non-standard stars in the mid-20th century have been replaced during revisions of the stellar classification system they may still be found in old editions of star catalogs r and n have been subsumed into the new c class as c-r and c-n
