the spectator wikipedia the spectator this article is about the uk political magazine for other uses see spectator disambiguation the spectator is a weekly british magazine on politics culture and current affairs 1 it was first published on 6 july 1828 2 it is currently owned by david and frederick barclay who also own the daily telegraph newspaper via press holdings its principal subject areas are politics and culture its editorial outlook is generally supportive of the conservative party although regular contributors include some outside that fold such as frank field rod liddle and martin bright the magazine also contains arts pages on books music opera and film and tv reviews in late 2008 spectator australia was launched this offers 12 pages of unique australian content including a separate editorial page in addition to the full uk contents editorship of the spectator has often been a step on the ladder to high office in the conservative party in the uk past editors include boris johnson 19992005 the incumbent foreign secretary and former cabinet members iain macleod ian gilmour and nigel lawson history edit first hundred years edit early years edit the spectator s founding editor the dundonian reformer robert stephen rintoul launched the paper on 5 december 1828 almost certainly there is no precise evidence he revived the title from the 1711 publication by addison steele as he had long been determined to edit a perfect newspaper 3 rintoul initially insisted on absolute power 3 over content commencing a long-lasting tradition of the papers editor and proprietor being one and the same person the spectator s political outlook in its first thirty years reflected rintouls liberal-radical agenda 4 despite its political stance it was widely regarded and respected for its non-partisanship 5 under rintoul the spectator came out strongly for the great reform act of 1832 coining the well-known phrase the bill the whole bill and nothing but the bill in its support it also objected to the appointment of the duke of wellington as prime minister condemning him as a field marshal whose political career proves him to be utterly destitute of political principle whose military career affords ample evidence of his stern and remorseless temperament 6 the magazine was vocal in its opposition to the first opium war 18391842 commenting all the alleged aims of the expedition against china are vague illimitable and incapable of explanation save only that of making the chinese pay the opium-smugglers 7 and there does not appear to be much glory gained in a contest so unequal that hundreds are killed on one side and none on the other what honour is there in going to shoot men certain that they cannot hurt you the cause of the war be it remembered is as disreputable as the strength of the parties is unequal the war is undertaken in support of a co-partnery of opium-smugglers in which the anglo-indian government may be considered as the principal partner 8 in 1853 it published an anonymous and unfavourable review of charles dickens bleak house later revealed to be by george brimley typical of the papers enduring contempt for him as a popular writer amusing the idle hours of the greatest number of readers not we may hope without improvement to their hearts but certainly without profoundly affecting their intellects or deeply stirring their emotions 9 rintoul died in april 1858 and the magazine whose circulation was falling was sold thereafter it went into an accelerated period of decline records are scarce but it appears that it was briefly owned by a mr scott and then bought for 4200 in december 1858 by two london-based americans james mchenry and benjamin moran mchenry was a businessman and moran was an assistant secretary to the ambassador george m dallas they saw their purchase as a means to influence british opinion on american affairs the editor was thornton hunt a friend of moran who had also worked for rintoul hunt was also nominally the purchaser having been given the necessary monies in an attempt by mchenry and moran to disguise the american ownership circulation declined with this loss of independence and inspirational leadership and the views of james buchanan the then president of the us came to the fore within weeks a the editorial line followed buchanans pronouncements in being neither pro-slavery nor pro-abolitionist to unsympathetic observers buchanans policy seemed to apportion blame for the impasse on the slavery question equally on pro-slavery and abolitionist factions and rather than work out a solution simply to argue that a solution would take time the spectator now would publicly support that policy 5 this set it at odds with most of the british press but gained it the sympathy of ex-patriate americans in the country richard fulton notes that from then until 1861 the spectators commentary on american affairs read like a buchanan administration propaganda sheet and that this represented a volte-face 5 meredith townsend richard holt hutton and john strachey edit on 19 january 1861 the spectator was bought by a journalist meredith townsend for 2000 the need to promote the buchanan position in britain had been reduced as british papers such as the times and the saturday review turned in his favour fearing the potential effects of a split in the union abraham lincoln had also replaced the vacillating buchanan and morans position in london was in doubt now that dallas had been removed as ambassador in addition the owners had been pumping money into a loss-making publication and were increasingly reluctant to continue the practice 5 from the outset townsend took up an anti-buchanan anti-slavery position arguing that his unwillingness to act decisively had been a weakness and a contributor to the problems apparent in the us 5 he soon went into partnership with richard holt hutton a theologian whose friend william gladstone later called him the first critic of the nineteenth century 4 townsends writing in the spectator confirmed him as one of the finest journalists of his day and he has since been called the greatest leader writer ever to appear in the english press 4 the two men remained co-proprietors and joint editors for 25 years taking a strong stand on some of the most controversial issues of their day they supported the federalists against the south in the american civil war an unpopular position which at the time did some damage to the papers circulation though gained readers in the long run when the north won 4 they also launched an all-out assault on benjamin disraeli accusing him in a series of leaders of jettisoning ethics for politics by ignoring the atrocities committed against bulgarian civilians by turkey in the 1870s in 1887 townsend was succeeded by john st loe strachey a young aristocrat who had replaced hh asquith the future prime minister as a leader-writer during the previous year as well as being the spectator s sole proprietor and editor he also became its chief leader-writer general manager and literature critic the papers circulation doubled under stracheys leadership becoming the most influential of all the london weeklies 10 before 1914 after falling ill in 1925 strachey finally sold his controlling interest in the paper to his business manager sir evelyn wrench and retired dying two years later in 1928 19281975 edit aberdare miners and 1930s europe edit perhaps wrenchs most remembered achievement as editor of the spectator was his campaign to ease unemployment in the mining town of aberdare one of the worst hit by the crisis of 1928 when joblessness reached 40 in south wales within three months the papers appeal for the towns relief raised over 12000 the equivalent of about 500000 today 10 a statuette presented in gratitude to the spectator of an aberdare miner still sits in the editors office bearing the inscription from the townsfolk of aberdare in grateful recognition the greatest of these is love 11 wrench retired as editor in 1932 though he remained the magazines proprietor appointing wilson harris his successor under harris the spectator became increasingly outspoken on developing international politics in the 1930s in particular on the rise of fascism beneath a readers letter referring to the nazi party as peaceful orderly and kindly harris printed the following reply no facts in recent history are established more incontestably than the numerous cases of murder assault and various forms of intimidation for which the national socialist party in germany has been responsible the organized economic boycott of the jews is the climax the spectator has consistently shown itself a friend of germany but it is a friend of freedom first resort to violence is not condoned by styling it revolution 12 in general however harris supported neville chamberlain s policy of appeasement praising the munich agreement explaining later that he believed even the most desperate attempt to save the peace was worthwhile 10 ian gilmour edit wrench sold the spectator in 1954 to barrister ian gilmour assuming the editorship himself from 1954 to 1959 gilmour adopted a libertarian and pro-european outlook and enlivened the paper and injected a new element of irreverence fun and controversy 4 he was critical of harold macmillan s government and while supporting the conservatives was also friendly to the hugh gaitskell wing of the labour party 13 gilmour famously lent the spectator s voice to the campaign to end capital punishment in britain writing an incensed leader attacking the hanging of ruth ellis in 1955 in which he claimed hanging has become the national sport and that the home secretary gwilym lloyd george for not reprieving the sentence has now been responsible for the hanging of two women over the past eight months 10 the spectator opposed britains involvement in the suez crisis in 1956 strongly criticizing the governments handling of the debacle the paper went on to oppose macmillans governments re-election in 1959 complaining the continued conservative pretence that suez was a good a noble a wise venture has been too much to stomach the government is taking its stand on a solid principle never admit a mistake 10 the paper also gave its support to the proposals of the wolfenden committee in 1957 condemning the utterly irrational and illogical old laws on homosexuality not only is the law unjust in conception it is almost inevitably unjust in practice 10 in march the same year jenny nicholson a frequent contributor wrote a piece on the italian socialist party congress in venice which mentioned three labour party politicians aneurin bevan richard crossman and morgan phillips who puzzled the italians by filling themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee 14 all three sued for libel the case went to trial and the spectator was forced to make a large payment in damages and costs a sum well over the equivalent of 150000 today 15 it has since emerged that all three plaintiffs to a greater or lesser degree perjured themselves in court 15 the tory leadership article edit in 1963 gilmour offered the editorship to iain macleod the politician who had recently resigned his cabinet seat in objection to the controversial appointment of sir alec douglas-home as prime minister in succession to harold macmillan the decision caused enormous controversy especially after macleod used the paper to explain his recent resignation in an article entitled the tory leadership ostensibly a review of a new book by randolph churchill macleod laid out his version of events in great detail in disclosing from the horses mouth the mysterious circumstances of douglas-homes appointment the article caused an immediate sensation churchills book was all but obliterated by the review which said that four fifths of it could have been compiled by anyone with a pair of scissors a pot of paste and a built-in prejudice against mr butler and sir william haley 16 that weeks edition bearing the headline iain macleod what happened sold a record number of copies nigel lawson george gale and harry creighton edit the tory leadership article prompted a furious response from many spectator readers and caused macleod for a time to be shunned by political colleagues he eventually regained his partys favour however and rejoined the shadow cabinet in the same year on his appointment as shadow chancellor in 1965 he stepped down as editor on the last day of the year to be replaced by nigel lawson sometimes called the great procrastinator because of his tendency to leave writing leaders until the last minute 4 lawson had been city editor for the sunday telegraph and alec douglas-homes personal assistant during the 1964 general election largely thanks to lawson in 1966 the spectator opposed americas increasing military commitment in vietnam in a signed article he estimated the risks involved in an american withdrawal from vietnam are less than the risks in escalating a bloody and brutal war 15 in 1967 ian gilmour who by then had joined parliament and was already finding the proprietorship less of a help than a hindrance in political life sold the spectator to harry creighton for 75000 17 in 1970 creighton replaced lawson as editor there had been growing resentment between the two men 15 with george gale gale shared creightons political outlook 4 in particular his strong opposition to the common market and much of the next five years was spent attacking the pro eec prime minister edward heath treating his eventual defeat by margaret thatcher with undisguised delight gales almost obsessive opposition to the eec and antagonistic attitude towards heath began to lose the magazine readers in 1973 creighton took over the editorship himself but was if possible even less successful in stemming the losses circulation fell from 36000 in 1966 to below 17000 as one journalist who joined the spectator at that time said it gave the impression an entirely accurate one of a publication surviving on a shoestring 15 george gale later remarked that creighton had only wanted the job to get into whos who 15 19752005 edit henry keswick and alexander chancellor edit in 1975 creighton sold the spectator to henry keswick again for 75000 creighton sold the 99 gower street premises separately so the magazine moved to offices in doughty street 18 keswick was chairman of the jardine matheson multinational corporation he was drawn to the paper partly because he harboured political aspirations the papers perk as a useful stepping stone to westminster was by now well established but also because his father had been a friend of peter fleming its well-known columnist keswick gave the job of editor to the only journalist he knew 15 alexander chancellor an old family friend and his mothers godson with whom he had been at eton and cambridge before then chancellor had worked at reuters news agency and had been a scriptwriter and reporter for itn in spite of his relative inexperience he was to become known as one of the best editors in the history of the spectator 15 chancellors editorship of the paper relied principally on a return to earlier values he adopted a new format and a more traditional weekly style with the front page displaying five cover lines above the leader most significantly he recognised the need to bring together a number of talented writers and with the minimal of editorial interference let them write 15 to this end he persuaded auberon waugh who had been sacked by nigel lawson to return from the new statesman and enticed richard west and jeffrey bernard from the same magazine another columnist recruited by chancellor was taki theodoracopulos whose column high life was then printed beside bernards low life takis column frequently criticised for its content by the press 19 remains in the paper in september 1978 a 96-page issue was released to mark the spectator s 150th anniversary william rees-mogg congratulated the paper in a times s leading article praising it in particular for its important part in the movement away from collectivism citation needed charles moore edit chancellor was replaced by the 28-year-old charles moore in february 1984 after the magazines then owner algy cluff had become concerned that the spectator was lacking in political weight and considered chancellor to be commercially irresponsible 15 moore had been a leader writer at the daily telegraph before chancellor recruited him to the spectator as political commentator the paper under moore became more political than it had been under chancellor the new editor adopted an approach that was in general pro margaret thatcher while showing no restraint in opposing her on certain issues the paper called the anglo-irish agreement a fraudulent prospectus in 1985 came out against the single european act and in 1989 criticised the handover of hong kong to china moore wrote that if britain failed to allow the citys uk passport holders right of abode in britain we shall have to confess that for the first time in our history we have forced britons to be slaves 20 he also introduced several new contributors including a restaurant column by nigella lawson the former editors daughter and a humorous column by craig brown when taki was briefly imprisoned for cocaine possession moore refused to accept his resignation explaining publicly we expect our high life columnist to be high some of the time 15 the spectator changed hands again in 1985 by which time it had accumulated an overdraft of over 300000 and it was facing financial meltdown cluff had reached the conclusion that the paper would be best secured in the hands of a publishing group and sold it to an australian company john fairfax ltd who promptly paid off the overdraft with the support of its new proprietor the paper was able to widen its readership through subscription drives and advertising reaching a circulation of 30000 in 1986 exceeding the circulation of the new statesman for the first time the magazine was again sold in 1988 after an uncertain period during which several candidates including rupert murdoch attempted to buy the magazine moore wrote to murdoch saying most of our contributors and many of our readers would be horrified at the idea of your buying the spectator they believe you are autocratic and that you have a bad effect on journalism of quality they cite the times as the chief example 15 in the end the spectator was bought by the telegraph group of which conrad black then had a controlling interest dominic lawson and frank johnson edit moore gave up the editorship in 1990 to become deputy editor of the daily telegraph though he continues to write a column for the magazine he was replaced by his own deputy editor dominic lawson the former editors son shortly after becoming editor lawson became responsible for the resignation of a cabinet minister when he interviewed the secretary of state for trade and industry nicholas ridley during the interview ridley described the proposed economic and monetary union as a german racket designed to take over the whole of europe 21 and seemed to draw comparisons between the german chancellor helmut kohl and adolf hitler the interview appeared in the issue of 14 july 1990 whose cover showed a cartoon by nicholas garland of ridley painting onto a poster of kohl a crude comb-over and a hitler moustache ridley resigned from thatchers government immediately the spectator caused controversy in 1994 when it printed an article entitled kings of the deal on a claimed jewish influence in hollywood written by william cash who at the time was based in los angeles and working mainly for the daily telegraph the telegraph had considered the article too risky to publish but lawson thought cashs idea was as old as hollywood itself and that his lawsons being jewish would mitigate adverse reactions to publication there was however considerable controversy although owner conrad black did not personally rebuke lawson max hastings then editor of the daily telegraph wrote with regard to black who also owned the jerusalem post at the time it was one of the few moments in my time with conrad when i saw him look seriously rattled you dont understand max my entire interests in the united states and internationally could be seriously damaged by this 22 the article was defended by some conservatives john derbyshire who says he has complicated and sometimes self-contradictory feelings about jews wrote on national review online regarding what he saw as the jewish overreaction to the article that it was a display of arrogance cruelty ignorance stupidity and sheer bad manners by rich and powerful people towards a harmless helpless young writer and the jews who whipped up this preposterous storm should all be thoroughly ashamed of themselves 23 lawson left in 1995 to become editor of the sunday telegraph and was replaced by a deputy editor of the same newspaper frank johnson after the 1997 election johnson averted a decline in the spectator s sales by recruiting new labour contributors and shifting the magazines direction slightly away from politics in 1996 the paper featured an interview with the spice girls in which the band members gave their euro-sceptic and generally anti-labour views on politics shortly before her death diana princess of wales was depicted on the magazines cover as the figurehead of mohamed al-fayed s boat the jonikal 24 boris johnson edit before joining the spectator as editor boris johnson had worked for the times the wolverhampton express star and the daily telegraph he had also briefly been political commentator for the spectator under dominic lawson but frank johnson replaced him with bruce anderson in 1995 succeeding frank johnson in 1999 johnson soon established himself as a competent and colourful 25 editor in the 2001 general election he was elected mp for henley and by 2004 had been made vice-chairman of the conservative party with a place in michael howard s shadow cabinet in 2003 he explained his editorial policy for the spectator would always be roughly speaking in favour of getting rid of saddam sticking up for israel free-market economics expanding choice and that the magazine was not necessarily a thatcherite conservative or a neo-conservative magazine even though in our editorial coverage we tend to follow roughly the conclusions of those lines of arguments 26 in october 2004 a spectator editorial suggested that the death of the hostage kenneth bigley was being over-sentimentalized by the people of liverpool accusing them of indulging in a vicarious victimhood and of possessing a deeply unattractive psyche 27 johnson had not written the leader but as editor took full responsibility for it michael howard subsequently ordered him to visit liverpool on a penitential pilgrimage 28 at this time the paper began jokingly to be referred to as the sextator a nickname for which johnson himself was more than a little responsible owing to the number of sex scandals connected with the magazine during his editorship these included an affair between columnist rod liddle and the magazines receptionist and johnsons own affair with another columnist petronella wyatt johnson at first denied the relationship dismissing the allegations as an inverted pyramid of piffle but was sacked from the shadow cabinet in november 2004 when they turned out to be true in the same year david blunkett the home secretary resigned from the government after it emerged he had been having an affair with the publisher of the spectator kimberly quinn and had fast-tracked her nannys visa application 29 circulation under johnson reached record levels as high as 70000 by the time he left the magazine in 2005 to join david cameron s shadow cabinet as shadow minister for higher education on the announcement of his departure andrew neil the spectator ceo paid tribute to his editorship 30 2006present edit matthew dancona edit dancona had been deputy editor at the sunday telegraph and before that an assistant editor at the times during his four years as editor of the spectator he made several editorial and structural changes to the magazine not all of which were universally popular with readers he ended the traditional summary of the weeks events portrait of the week and in 2006 launched a new lifestyle section entitled you earned it he removed peter oborne as political editor and appointed fraser nelson in his place he decided not to appoint a new media columnist to succeed stephen glover explaining i do not think the spectator needs a media columnist our pages are precious and i do not think the internal wranglings of our trade are high on the list of spectator readers priorities 31 perhaps the magazines most important innovation under dancona was the coffee house blog led by peter hoskin and james forsyth launched in may 2007 32 in 2007 the spectator moved its offices from doughty street which had been its home for 31 years to 22 old queen street in westminster leaving bloomsbury for the first time since the papers founding in 1828 fraser nelson edit the spectator s current editor is fraser nelson who replaced dancona in august 2009 in 2010 he unveiled a slight redesign of the paper shrinking the cover illustration slightly shifting the cover lines in general to the bottom and spreading the contents section over a double-page playing down the changes nelson described the new look as a tidy-up rather like restoring an old painting 33 an article in november 2011 by rod liddle on the trial of two men eventually convicted for the murder of stephen lawrence led to the crown prosecution service cps deciding to prosecute the magazine for breaching reporting restrictions 34 the magazine chose not to contest the case 35 and the publisher spectator 1828 ltd pleaded guilty at the court hearing at westminster magistrates court on 7 june 2012 36 the magazine was fined 3000 with 2000 compensation awarded to stephen lawrences parents and 625 costs 37 according to nelson readers most common reaction to the columnist was dont tone down rod but our non-readers dont like him 38 in june 2013 the spectator archive was launched 39 containing 1.5 million pages from 180 years of published articles in august 2015 the spectator received media attention and criticism after publishing an article by charles moore regarding the 2015 labour party leadership election titled have yvette cooper and liz kendall got the looks for a leadership contest in which he wrote there is an understanding that no leader especially despite the age of equality a woman can look grotesque on television and win a general election and discussed the looks of the two female candidates in detail the article was condemned by liz kendall first minister of scotland nicola sturgeon candidate for labour nomination for mayor of london and former minister and mp tessa jowell along with several journalists and mps from various parties 40 41 policy positions edit like its sister publication the daily telegraph the spectator is generally atlanticist and eurosceptic in outlook favouring close ties with the united states rather than with the european union and supportive of israel citation needed it also strongly opposes scottish independence however it has expressed strong doubts about the iraq war and some of its contributors such as matthew parris and stuart reid express a more old-school conservative position some contributors such as irwin stelzer argue from an american neoconservative position citation needed unlike much of the british press it is approving of the unilateral extradition treaty that allowed the natwest three to be extradited and in july 2006 the magazine devoted a leading article to praising the us senate 42 cultural positions edit the spectator is one of the few british publications that tends to be cautious of idolising examples of popular culture in the way that for example the daily telegraph did under bill deedes or the times did under william haley citation needed the magazine coined the phrase young fogey in 1984 43 not in citation given the spectator does have a popular music column though it only appears every four weeks while a cinema column contains a review of one film each week by deborah ross by contrast opera fine art books poetry and classical music all receive extensive weekly coverage contributors edit in addition to the permanent staff of writers other contributors include editors edit the editors of the spectator have been
