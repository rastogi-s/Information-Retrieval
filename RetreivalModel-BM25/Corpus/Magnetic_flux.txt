magnetic flux wikipedia magnetic flux this article is about magnetic flux for the magnetic fields b magnetic flux density and h see magnetic field in physics specifically electromagnetism the magnetic flux often denoted or b through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field b passing through that surface the si unit of magnetic flux is the weber wb in derived units volt-seconds and the cgs unit is the maxwell magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter which contains measuring coils and electronics that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux description edit the magnetic flux through a surfacewhen the magnetic field is variablerelies on splitting the surface into small surface elements over which the magnetic field can be considered to be locally constant the total flux is then a formal summation of these surface elements see surface integration each point on a surface is associated with a direction called the surface normal the magnetic flux through a point is then the component of the magnetic field along this direction the magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field where each point in space and time is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point see lorentz force 1 since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize at first in elementary physics one may instead visualize this field with field lines the magnetic flux through some surface in this simplified picture is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface in some contexts the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface although technically misleading this distinction is not important note that the magnetic flux is the net number of field lines passing through that surface that is the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign 2 in more advanced physics the field line analogy is dropped and the magnetic flux is properly defined as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface if the magnetic field is constant the magnetic flux passing through a surface of vector area s is where b is the magnitude of the magnetic field the magnetic flux density having the unit of wbm 2 tesla s is the area of the surface and is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal perpendicular to s for a varying magnetic field we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element d s where we may consider the field to be constant a generic surface s can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the surface integral from the definition of the magnetic vector potential a and the fundamental theorem of the curl the magnetic flux may also be defined as where the line integral is taken over the boundary of the surface s which is denoted s magnetic flux through a closed surface edit main article gausss law for magnetism gausss law for magnetism which is one of the four maxwells equations states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero a closed surface is a surface that completely encloses a volumes with no holes this law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found in other words gausss law for magnetism is the statement for any closed surface s magnetic flux through an open surface edit while the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero the magnetic flux through an open surface need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism citation needed changing magnetic flux edit main article faradays law of induction for example a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an electromotive force and therefore an electric current in the loop the relationship is given by faradays law where is the electromotive force emf b is the magnetic flux through the open surface is the boundary of the open surface note that the surface in general may be in motion and deforming and so is generally a function of time the electromotive force is induced along this boundary d is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour v is the velocity of the boundary e is the electric field b is the magnetic field the two equations for the emf are firstly the work per unit charge done against the lorentz force in moving a test charge around the possibly moving surface boundary and secondly as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface this equation is the principle behind an electrical generator area defined by an electric coil with three turns comparison with electric flux edit main articles electric flux and gausss law by way of contrast gausss law for electric fields another of maxwells equations is where e is the electric field s is any closed surface q is the total electric charge inside the surface s 0 is the electric constant a universal constant also called the permittivity of free space note that the flux of e through a closed surface is not always zero this indicates the presence of electric monopoles that is free positive or negative charges
