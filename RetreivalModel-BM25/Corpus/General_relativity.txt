general relativity wikipedia general relativity for the book by robert wald see general relativity book for a more accessible and less technical introduction to this topic see introduction to general relativity general relativity gr also known as the general theory of relativity or gtr is the geometric theory of gravitation published by albert einstein in 1915 2 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics general relativity has been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories 3 4 general relativity generalizes special relativity and newtons law of universal gravitation providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or spacetime in particular the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present the relation is specified by the einstein field equations a system of partial differential equations some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics especially concerning the passage of time the geometry of space the motion of bodies in free fall and the propagation of light examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation gravitational lensing the gravitational redshift of light and the gravitational time delay the predictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data however unanswered questions remain the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity einsteins theory has important astrophysical implications for example it implies the existence of black holesregions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing not even light can escapeas an end-state for massive stars there is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes for example microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes respectively the bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky general relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration ligo in addition general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe history edit main articles history of general relativity and classical theories of gravitation soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905 einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework in 1907 beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity after numerous detours and false starts his work culminated in the presentation to the prussian academy of science in november 1915 of what are now known as the einstein field equations these equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present and form the core of einsteins general theory of relativity 5 the einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory but as early as 1916 the astrophysicist karl schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the einstein field equations the schwarzschild metric this solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse and the objects known today as black holes in the same year the first steps towards generalizing schwarzschilds solution to electrically charged objects were taken which eventually resulted in the reissnernordstrm solution now associated with electrically charged black holes 6 in 1917 einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole initiating the field of relativistic cosmology in line with contemporary thinking he assumed a static universe adding a new parameter to his original field equationsthe cosmological constant to match that observational presumption 7 by 1929 however the work of hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding this is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by friedmann in 1922 which do not require a cosmological constant lematre used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the big bang models in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state 8 einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life 9 during that period general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories it was clearly superior to newtonian gravity being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the newtonian theory einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet mercury without any arbitrary parameters fudge factors 10 similarly a 1919 expedition led by eddington confirmed general relativitys prediction for the deflection of starlight by the sun during the total solar eclipse of may 29 1919 11 making einstein instantly famous 12 yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975 now known as the golden age of general relativity 13 physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole and to identify quasars as one of these objects astrophysical manifestations 14 ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theorys predictive power 15 and relativistic cosmology too became amenable to direct observational tests 16 from classical mechanics to general relativity edit general relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics the first step is the realization that classical mechanics and newtons law of gravity admit a geometric description the combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity 17 geometry of newtonian gravity edit at the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body s motion can be described as a combination of free or inertial motion and deviations from this free motion such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with newtons second law of motion which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that bodys inertial mass multiplied by its acceleration 18 the preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed in modern parlance their paths are geodesics straight world lines in curved spacetime 19 conversely one might expect that inertial motions once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces such as electromagnetism or friction can be used to define the geometry of space as well as a time coordinate however there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play according to newtons law of gravity and independently verified by experiments such as that of etvs and its successors see etvs experiment there is a universality of free fall also known as the weak equivalence principle or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed but not on any of its material properties 20 a simplified version of this is embodied in einsteins elevator experiment illustrated in the figure on the right for an observer in a small enclosed room it is impossible to decide by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field 21 given the universality of free fall there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force this suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity this new class of preferred motions too defines a geometry of space and timein mathematical terms it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential space in this construction still has the ordinary euclidean geometry however space time as a whole is more complicated as can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particles velocity time-like vectors will vary with the particles trajectory mathematically speaking the newtonian connection is not integrable from this one can deduce that spacetime is curved the resulting newtoncartan theory is a geometric formulation of newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts ie a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system 22 in this geometric description tidal effects the relative acceleration of bodies in free fallare related to the derivative of the connection showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass 23 relativistic generalization edit as intriguing as geometric newtonian gravity may be its basis classical mechanics is merely a limiting case of special relativistic mechanics 24 in the language of symmetry where gravity can be neglected physics is lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than galilei invariant as in classical mechanics the defining symmetry of special relativity is the poincar group which includes translations rotations and boosts the differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light and with high-energy phenomena 25 with lorentz symmetry additional structures come into play they are defined by the set of light cones see image the light-cones define a causal structure for each event a there is a set of events that can in principle either influence or be influenced by a via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light such as event b in the image and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible such as event c in the image these sets are observer-independent 26 in conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the spacetimes semi-riemannian metric at least up to a positive scalar factor in mathematical terms this defines a conformal structure 27 or conformal geometry special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity so for practical applications it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected bringing gravity into play and assuming the universality of free fall an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies there are no global inertial frames instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles translated into the language of spacetime the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry 28 a priori it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity holdthat theory is based on the propagation of light and thus on electromagnetism which could have a different set of preferred frames but using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames such as their being earth-fixed or in free fall one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift that is the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field cf below the actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity 29 the generalization of this statement namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling and non-rotating reference frames is known as the einstein equivalence principle a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity 30 the same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field proper time to give the technical termdoes not follow the rules of special relativity in the language of spacetime geometry it is not measured by the minkowski metric as in the newtonian case this is suggestive of a more general geometry at small scales all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent and approximately minkowskian consequently we are now dealing with a curved generalization of minkowski space the metric tensor that defines the geometryin particular how lengths and angles are measuredis not the minkowski metric of special relativity it is a generalization known as a semi or pseudo-riemannian metric furthermore each riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection the levi-civita connection and this is in fact the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally minkowskian that is in suitable locally inertial coordinates the metric is minkowskian and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish 31 einsteins equations edit main articles einstein field equations and mathematics of general relativity having formulated the relativistic geometric version of the effects of gravity the question of gravitys source remains in newtonian gravity the source is mass in special relativity mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energymomentum tensor which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress pressure and shear 32 using the equivalence principle this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime drawing further upon the analogy with geometric newtonian gravity it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the ricci tensor which describes a particular class of tidal effects the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest and then fall freely in special relativity conservation of energy momentum corresponds to the statement that the energymomentum tensor is divergence free this formula too is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved manifold counterparts covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry with this additional conditionthe covariant divergence of the energymomentum tensor and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation is zero the simplest set of equations are what are called einsteins field equations on the left-hand side is the einstein tensor a specific divergence-free combination of the ricci tensor and the metric where is symmetric in particular is the curvature scalar the ricci tensor itself is related to the more general riemann curvature tensor as on the right-hand side is the energymomentum tensor all tensors are written in abstract index notation 33 matching the theorys prediction to observational results for planetary orbits or equivalently assuring that the weak-gravity low-speed limit is newtonian mechanics the proportionality constant can be fixed as 8 g c 4 with g the gravitational constant and c the speed of light 34 when there is no matter present so that the energymomentum tensor vanishes the results are the vacuum einstein equations alternatives to general relativity edit main article alternatives to general relativity there are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises which include additional rules andor constraints leading to different field equations examples are whiteheads theory bransdicke theory teleparallelism fr gravity and einsteincartan theory 35 definition and basic applications edit see also mathematics of general relativity and physical theories modified by general relativity the derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity describe its key properties and address a question of crucial importance in physics namely how the theory can be used for model-building definition and basic properties edit general relativity is a metric theory of gravitation at its core are einsteins equations which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional pseudo-riemannian manifold representing spacetime and the energymomentum contained in that spacetime 36 phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity such as free-fall orbital motion and spacecraft trajectories correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural straight paths instead gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow 37 the curvature is in turn caused by the energymomentum of matter paraphrasing the relativist john archibald wheeler spacetime tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve 38 while general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank two tensor the latter reduces to the former in certain limiting cases for weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light the theorys predictions converge on those of newtons law of universal gravitation 39 as it is constructed using tensors general relativity exhibits general covariance its lawsand further laws formulated within the general relativistic frameworktake on the same form in all coordinate systems 40 furthermore the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures ie it is background independent it thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers 41 locally as expressed in the equivalence principle spacetime is minkowskian and the laws of physics exhibit local lorentz invariance 42 model-building edit the core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a solution of einsteins equations given both einsteins equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter such a solution consists of a specific semi-riemannian manifold usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates and specific matter fields defined on that manifold matter and geometry must satisfy einsteins equations so in particular the matters energymomentum tensor must be divergence-free the matter must of course also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties in short such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present 43 einsteins equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and as such difficult to solve exactly 44 nevertheless a number of exact solutions are known although only a few have direct physical applications 45 the best-known exact solutions and also those most interesting from a physics point of view are the schwarzschild solution the reissnernordstrm solution and the kerr metric each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe 46 and the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker and de sitter universes each describing an expanding cosmos 47 exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the gdel universe which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes the taub-nut solution a model universe that is homogeneous but anisotropic and anti-de sitter space which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the maldacena conjecture 48 given the difficulty of finding exact solutions einsteins field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions in the field of numerical relativity powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve einsteins equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes 49 in principle such methods may be applied to any system given sufficient computer resources and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity 50 and its generalization the post-newtonian expansion both of which were developed by einstein the latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light the expansion involves a series of terms the first terms represent newtonian gravity whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to newtons theory due to general relativity 51 an extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-newtonian ppn formalism which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories 52 consequences of einsteins theory edit general relativity has a number of physical consequences some follow directly from the theorys axioms whereas others have become clear only in the course of many years of research that followed einsteins initial publication gravitational time dilation and frequency shift edit main article gravitational time dilation assuming that the equivalence principle holds 53 gravity influences the passage of time light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted whereas light sent in the opposite direction ie climbing out of the gravity well is redshifted collectively these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift more generally processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away this effect is known as gravitational time dilation 54 gravitational redshift has been measured in the laboratory 55 and using astronomical observations 56 gravitational time dilation in the earths gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks 57 while ongoing validation is provided as a side effect of the operation of the global positioning system gps 58 tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars 59 all results are in agreement with general relativity 60 however at the current level of accuracy these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid 61 light deflection and gravitational time delay edit main articles kepler problem in general relativity gravitational lens and shapiro delay general relativity predicts that the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star this effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the sun 62 this and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesica generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity 63 as one examines suitable model spacetimes either the exterior schwarzschild solution or for more than a single mass the post-newtonian expansion 64 several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light 65 the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity 66 closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay or shapiro delay the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field there have been numerous successful tests of this prediction 67 in the parameterized post-newtonian formalism ppn measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space 68 gravitational waves edit main article gravitational wave predicted in 1916 69 70 by albert einstein there are gravitational waves ripples in the metric of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light these are one of several analogies between weak-field gravity and electromagnetism in that they are analogous to electromagnetic waves on february 11 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging 71 72 73 the simplest type of such a wave can be visualized by its action on a ring of freely floating particles a sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic rhythmic fashion animated image to the right 74 since einsteins equations are non-linear arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition making their description difficult however for weak fields a linear approximation can be made such linearized gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves that are expected to arrive here on earth from far-off cosmic events which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by or less data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be fourier decomposed 75 some exact solutions describe gravitational waves without any approximation eg a wave train traveling through empty space 76 or gowdy universes varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves 77 but for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations such as the merger of two black holes numerical methods are presently the only way to construct appropriate models 78 orbital effects and the relativity of direction edit main article kepler problem in general relativity general relativity differs from classical mechanics in a number of predictions concerning orbiting bodies it predicts an overall rotation precession of planetary orbits as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction precession of apsides edit in general relativity the apsides of any orbit the point of the orbiting bodys closest approach to the systems center of mass will precessthe orbit is not an ellipse but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus resulting in a rose curve like shape see image einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle for him the fact that his theory gave a straightforward explanation of mercurys anomalous perihelion shift discovered earlier by urbain le verrier in 1859 was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations 79 the effect can also be derived by using either the exact schwarzschild metric describing spacetime around a spherical mass 80 or the much more general post-newtonian formalism 81 it is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a bodys gravity encoded in the nonlinearity of einsteins equations 82 relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements mercury venus and earth 83 as well as in binary pulsar systems where it is larger by five orders of magnitude 84 in general relativity the perihelion shift expressed in radians per revolution is approximately given by 85 where is the semi-major axis is the orbital period is the speed of light is the orbital eccentricity orbital decay edit according to general relativity a binary system will emit gravitational waves thereby losing energy due to this loss the distance between the two orbiting bodies decreases and so does their orbital period within the solar system or for ordinary double stars the effect is too small to be observable this is not the case for a close binary pulsar a system of two orbiting neutron stars one of which is a pulsar from the pulsar observers on earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock which allows precise measurements of the orbital period because neutron stars are immensely compact significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation 87 the first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by hulse and taylor using the binary pulsar psr191316 they had discovered in 1974 this was the first detection of gravitational waves albeit indirect for which they were awarded the 1993 nobel prize in physics 88 since then several other binary pulsars have been found in particular the double pulsar psr j0737-3039 in which both stars are pulsars 89 geodetic precession and frame-dragging edit main articles geodetic precession and frame dragging several relativistic effects are directly related to the relativity of direction 90 one is geodetic precession the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared for instance with the direction of light received from distant starseven though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible parallel transport 91 for the moonearth system this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging 92 more recently it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite gravity probe b to a precision of better than 0.3 93 94 near a rotating mass there are gravitomagnetic or frame-dragging effects a distant observer will determine that objects close to the mass get dragged around this is most extreme for rotating black holes where for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere rotation is inevitable 95 such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall 96 somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the lageos satellites confirming the relativistic prediction 97 also the mars global surveyor probe around mars has been used 98 99 astrophysical applications edit gravitational lensing edit main article gravitational lensing the deflection of light by gravity is responsible for a new class of astronomical phenomena if a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target such effects are known as gravitational lensing 100 depending on the configuration scale and mass distribution there can be two or more images a bright ring known as an einstein ring or partial rings called arcs 101 the earliest example was discovered in 1979 102 since then more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed 103 even if the multiple images are too close to each other to be resolved the effect can still be measured eg as an overall brightening of the target object a number of such microlensing events have been observed 104 gravitational lensing has developed into a tool of observational astronomy it is used to detect the presence and distribution of dark matter provide a natural telescope for observing distant galaxies and to obtain an independent estimate of the hubble constant statistical evaluations of lensing data provide valuable insight into the structural evolution of galaxies 105 gravitational wave astronomy edit main articles gravitational wave and gravitational wave astronomy observations of binary pulsars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves see orbital decay above detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research 106 several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation most notably the interferometric detectors geo 600 ligo two detectors tama 300 and virgo 107 various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10 9 to 10 6 hertz frequency range which originate from binary supermassive blackholes 108 a european space-based detector elisa ngo is currently under development 109 with a precursor mission lisa pathfinder having launched in december 2015 110 observations of gravitational waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum 111 they are expected to yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs about certain kinds of supernova implosions and about processes in the very early universe including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string 112 in february 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger 71 72 113 black holes and other compact objects edit main article black hole whenever the ratio of an objects mass to its radius becomes sufficiently large general relativity predicts the formation of a black hole a region of space from which nothing not even light can escape in the currently accepted models of stellar evolution neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars 114 usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center 115 and its presence is thought to have played an important role in the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures 116 astronomically the most important property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation 117 accretion the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes is thought to be responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars 118 in particular accretion can lead to relativistic jets focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed 119 general relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena 120 and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory 121 black holes are also sought-after targets in the search for gravitational waves cf gravitational waves above merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors here on earth and the phase directly before the merger chirp could be used as a standard candle to deduce the distance to the merger eventsand hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances 122 the gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black holes geometry 123 cosmology edit main article physical cosmology the current models of cosmology are based on einsteins field equations which include the cosmological constant since it has important influence on the large-scale dynamics of the cosmos where is the spacetime metric 124 isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker solutions 125 allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14 billion years from a hot early big bang phase 126 once a small number of parameters for example the universes mean matter density have been fixed by astronomical observation 127 further observational data can be used to put the models to the test 128 predictions all successful include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis 129 the large-scale structure of the universe 130 and the existence and properties of a thermal echo from the early cosmos the cosmic background radiation 131 astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part about 90 of all matter appears to be dark matter which has mass or equivalently gravitational influence but does not interact electromagnetically and hence cannot be observed directly 132 there is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter within the framework of known particle physics 133 or otherwise 134 observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or equivalently by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state known as dark energy the nature of which remains unclear 135 an inflationary phase 136 an additional phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10 33 seconds was hypothesized in 1980 to account for several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation 137 recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario 138 however there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios which cannot be restricted by current observations 139 an even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity an authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity which has not yet been developed 140 cf the section on quantum gravity below time travel edit kurt gdel showed 141 that solutions to einsteins equations exist that contain closed timelike curves ctcs which allow for loops in time the solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever to occur in practice and it remains an open question whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely since then othersimilarly impracticalgr solutions containing ctcs have been found such as the tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes advanced concepts edit causal structure and global geometry edit main article causal structure in general relativity no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse no influence from an event a can reach any other location x before light sent out at a to x in consequence an exploration of all light worldlines null geodesics yields key information about the spacetimes causal structure this structure can be displayed using penrosecarter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk compactified so as to fit onto a finite map while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams 142 aware of the importance of causal structure roger penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry in global geometry the object of study is not one particular solution or family of solutions to einsteins equations rather relations that hold true for all geodesics such as the raychaudhuri equation and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter usually in the form of energy conditions are used to derive general results 143 horizons edit main articles horizon general relativity no hair theorem and black hole mechanics using global geometry some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime the best-known examples are black holes if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space as specified in the hoop conjecture the relevant length scale is the schwarzschild radius 144 no light from inside can escape to the outside since no object can overtake a light pulse all interior matter is imprisoned as well passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible showing that the boundary the black holes horizon is not a physical barrier 145 early studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of einsteins equations notably the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution used to describe a static black hole and the axisymmetric kerr solution used to describe a rotating stationary black hole and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere using global geometry later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes in the long run they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy linear momentum angular momentum location at a specified time and electric charge this is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorems black holes have no hair that is no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole the object that results having emitted gravitational waves is very simple 146 even more remarkably there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics for instance by the second law of black hole mechanics the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system this limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole eg by the penrose process 147 there is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are in fact a subset of the laws of thermodynamics and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy 148 this leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics for instance as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics it is possible for black hole area to decreaseas long as other processes ensure that overall entropy increases as thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature black holes should emit thermal radiation semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in plancks law this radiation is known as hawking radiation cf the quantum theory section below 149 there are other types of horizons in an expanding universe an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed particle horizon and some regions of the future cannot be influenced event horizon 150 even in flat minkowski space when described by an accelerated observer rindler space there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as unruh radiation 151 singularities edit main article spacetime singularity another general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesicsall possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel but some solutions of einsteins equations have ragged edgesregions known as spacetime singularities where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end and geometry becomes ill-defined in the more interesting cases these are curvature singularities where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature such as the ricci scalar take on infinite values 152 well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularitieswhere worldlines endare the schwarzschild solution which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole 153 or the kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole 154 the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin namely big bang singularities and some have future singularities big crunch as well 155 given that these examples are all highly symmetricand thus simplifiedit is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization 156 the famous singularity theorems proved using the methods of global geometry say otherwise singularities are a generic feature of general relativity and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage 157 and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes 158 however the theorems say little about the properties of singularities and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities generic structure hypothesized eg by the bkl conjecture 159 the cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities no perfect symmetries matter with realistic properties are safely hidden away behind a horizon and thus invisible to all distant observers while no formal proof yet exists numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity 160 evolution equations edit main article initial value formulation general relativity each solution of einsteins equation encompasses the whole history of a universe it is not just some snapshot of how things are but a whole possibly matter-filled spacetime it describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe due to its general covariance einsteins theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor it must be combined with a coordinate condition which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories 161 to understand einsteins equations as partial differential equations it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time this is done in 31 formulations where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension the best-known example is the adm formalism 162 these decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved solutions always exist and are uniquely defined once suitable initial conditions have been specified 163 such formulations of einsteins field equations are the basis of numerical relativity 164 global and quasi-local quantities edit main article mass in general relativity the notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics in einsteins theory it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a systems total mass or energy the main reason is that the gravitational fieldlike any physical fieldmust be ascribed a certain energy but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy 165 nevertheless there are possibilities to define a systems total mass either using a hypothetical infinitely distant observer adm mass 166 or suitable symmetries komar mass 167 if one excludes from the systems total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves the result is the bondi mass at null infinity 168 just as in classical physics it can be shown that these masses are positive 169 corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum 170 there have also been a number of attempts to define quasi-local quantities such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system the hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture 171 relationship with quantum theory edit if general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics then quantum theory the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics would be the other 172 however how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question quantum field theory in curved spacetime edit main article quantum field theory in curved spacetime ordinary quantum field theories which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics are defined in flat minkowski space which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on earth 173 in order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence quantum matter yet not strong enough to require quantization itself physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime these theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime 174 using this formalism it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time 175 as briefly mentioned above this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes 176 quantum gravity edit main article quantum gravity see also string theory canonical general relativity loop quantum gravity causal dynamical triangulations and causal sets the demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime 177 as well as the appearance of singularities where curvature length scales become microscopic indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity for an adequate description of the interior of black holes and of the very early universe a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics 178 despite major efforts no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known even though a number of promising candidates exist 179 180 attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions so as to include gravity have led to serious problems 181 some have argued that at low energies this approach proves successful in that it results in an acceptable effective quantum field theory of gravity 182 at very high energies however the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power perturbative non-renormalizability 183 one attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory a quantum theory not of point particles but of minute one-dimensional extended objects 184 the theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions including gravity 185 the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three 186 in what is called the second superstring revolution it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity 187 form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as m-theory which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity 188 another approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity cf evolution equations above the result is the wheelerdewitt equation an analogue of the schrdinger equation which regrettably turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet lattice cutoff 189 however with the introduction of what are now known as ashtekar variables 190 this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network evolving over time in discrete steps 191 depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged and on what level changes are introduced 192 there are numerous other attempts to arrive at a viable theory of quantum gravity some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the feynman path integral approach and regge calculus 179 dynamical triangulations 193 causal sets 194 twistor models 195 or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology 196 all candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome they also face the common problem that as yet there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available 197 current status edit general relativity has emerged as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests however there are strong indications the theory is incomplete 198 the problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open 199 observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics 200 even taken as is general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of einsteins equations 201 while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations such as those describing merging black holes 202 in february 2016 it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the advanced ligo team on september 14 2015 73 203 204 a century after its introduction general relativity remains a highly active area of research 205
