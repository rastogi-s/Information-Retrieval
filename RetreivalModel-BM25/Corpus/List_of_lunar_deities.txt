found in most ancient religions moon in religion and mythology edit the monthly cycle of the moon in contrast to the annual cycle of the suns path has been implicitly linked to womens menstrual cycles by many cultures as evident in the links between the words for menstruation and for moon in many resultant languages 1 many of the most well-known mythologies feature female lunar deities such as the greek goddesses phoebe artemis selene and hecate as well as the chinese goddess change male lunar gods are also frequent such as sin of the mesopotamians mani of the germanic tribes and the japanese god tsukuyomi these cultures usually featured female sun goddesses there are also many lunar deities that were prevalent in greek and egyptian civilizations for example ibis and chonsu of thebes were both lunar deities thoth was also a lunar deity but his character is considerably more complex than ibis and chonsu 2 set represented the moon in the egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days of papyrus cairo 86637 3 the original proto-indo-european lunar deity appears to have been a male god 4 several goddesses like artemis or hecate did not originally have lunar aspects and only acquired them late in antiquity due to syncretism with selene luna the de facto greco-latin lunar deity in traditions with male gods there is little evidence of such syncretism though the greco-roman hermes has been equated with male egyptian lunar gods like thoth in greece proper remnants of male moon gods are also seen with menelaus also of significance is that many religions and societies are oriented
