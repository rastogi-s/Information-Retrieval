black sea wikipedia black sea this article is about the body of water for other uses see black sea disambiguation the black sea is a body of water and marginal sea of the atlantic ocean between eastern europe the caucasus and western asia 1 it is supplied by a number of major rivers such as the danube dnieper southern bug dniester don and the rioni about a third of europe drains into the black sea 2 including the countries of austria belarus bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia georgia germany hungary moldova poland romania russia serbia slovakia slovenia turkey and ukraine the black sea has an area of 436400km 2 168500sqmi not including the sea of azov 3 a maximum depth of 2212m 7257ft 4 and a volume of 547000km 3 131000cumi 5 it is constrained by the pontic mountains to the south caucasus mountains to the east crimean mountains to the north strandzha to the southwest dobrogea plateau to the northwest and features a wide shelf to the northwest the longest east-west extent is about 1175km 730mi important cities along the coast include batumi burgas constana giresun istanbul kerch novorossiysk odessa ordu poti rize samsun sevastopol sochi sukhumi trabzon varna yalta and zonguldak the black sea has a positive water balance that is a net outflow of water 300km 3 72cumi per year through the bosphorus and the dardanelles into the aegean sea mediterranean water flows into the black sea as part of a two-way hydrological exchange the black sea outflow is cooler and less saline and floats over the warm more saline mediterranean inflow as a result of differences in density caused by differences in salinity leading to a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters the black sea drains into the mediterranean sea via the aegean sea and various straits and is navigable to the atlantic ocean the bosphorus strait connects it to the sea of marmara and the strait of the dardanelles connects that sea to the aegean sea region of the mediterranean these waters separate eastern europe the caucasus and western asia the black sea is also connected to the sea of azov by the strait of kerch the water level has varied significantly due to these variations in the water level in the basin the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been land at certain critical water levels it is possible for connections with surrounding water bodies to become established it is through the most active of these connective routes the turkish straits that the black sea joins the world ocean when this hydrological link is not present the black sea is an endorheic basin operating independently of the global ocean system like the caspian sea for example currently the black sea water level is relatively high thus water is being exchanged with the mediterranean the turkish straits connect the black sea with the aegean sea and comprise the bosphorus the sea of marmara and the dardanelles extent edit the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the black sea as follows 6 on the southwest the northeastern limit of the sea of marmara a line joining cape rumili with cape anatoli 4113n in the kertch strait a line joining cape takil and cape panaghia 4502n population edit name edit modern names edit current names of the sea are usually equivalents of the english name black sea including these given in the countries

names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 13thcentury 14 but there are indications that they may be considerably older citation needed in greece the historical name euxine sea which holds a different meaning see below is still widely used greek language fxeinos pntos e the literal mavri thalassa is less common the black sea is one of four seas named in english after common colour terms the others being the red sea the white sea and the yellow sea historical names and etymology edit the principal greek name pntos xeinos itself is generally accepted to be a rendering of iranian axaina dark colored cf avestan axana dark colored old persian axaina color of turquoise middle persian axnxan blue and new persian xan blue as well as ossetic xsn dark gray 14 the ancient greeks subsequently adopted the name reportedly in all likelihood those who lived to the north of the black sea and altered it into xeinos 14 thereafter greek tradition refers to the black sea as the inhospitable sea pntos xeinos first attested in pindar c 475bc 14 the name considered to be ominous was then later changed into the euphemism hospitable sea exeinos pntos which was also for the first time attested in pindar 14 this became the commonly used designation in greek for the sea 14 in contexts related to mythology the older form pntos xeinos remained favored 14 previously it was erroneously suggested that the name had to be derived from the color of the water or at least were to be related to climatic particulars 14 black or dark in this context however referred to a system in which colors represented the various cardinal points of the known world 14 black or dark represented the north red the south white for the west and green or light blue for the east 14 this symbolism based on cardinal points was used in a plethora of different occasions and is therefore widely attested 14 for example the red sea a body of water reported since the time of herodotus c 484c 425bc in fact designated the indian ocean together with bodies of water known as the persian gulf and the actual red sea 14 according to the same explanation and reasoning it is therefore considered to be impossible for the scythians who principally roamed in what is present-day ukraine and russia to have given the designation as they lived to the north of the sea and it would be therefore a southern antipodal body of water for them 14 as the name could have only been given by a people that were well aware of both the northern blackdark and southern red seas it is therefore considered probable that it was given its name by the achaemenids 550330 bc 14 strabo s geographica 1210 reports that in antiquity the black sea was often just called the sea ho pontos he also thought that the black sea was called inhospitable before greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes736 the name was changed to hospitable after the milesians had colonized the southern shoreline the pontus making it part of greek civilization in greater bundahishn a sacred zoroastrian text written in middle persian the black sea is called siybun 15 a map of asia dating to 1570 entitled asiae nova descriptio from abraham ortelius s theatrum orbis terrarum labels the sea mar maggior great sea cf latin mare major english-language writers of the 18th century often used the name euxine sea j u k s n or j u k s a n to refer to the black sea edward gibbon for instance calls the sea by this name throughout the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire 16 during the ottoman empire period the black sea was called either bahr-e siyah or karadeniz both meaning the black sea in the ottoman turkish it is worthy to note that in the tenth-century geography book hudud al-alam written in the persian language by an unknown author the black sea is called georgian sea sea of georgians dary-yi gurziyan old georgian sources of 9th14th centuries the georgian chronicles were using the name speris zua which means the sea of speri after the name of kartvelian tribe speris or saspers now in turkey the modern names of the black sea chyornoye more karadeniz etc stretch only back to the 13th century 14 geology and bathymetry edit the geological origins of the basin can be traced back to two distinct relict back-arc basins which were initiated by the splitting of an albian volcanic arc and the subduction of both the paleo and neo tethys oceans but the timings of these events remain controversial 17 18 since its initiation compressional tectonic environments led to subsidence in the basin interspersed with extensional phases resulting in large-scale volcanism and numerous orogenies causing the uplift of the greater caucasus pontides southern crimean peninsula and balkanides mountain ranges 19 the ongoing collision between the eurasian and african plates and westward escape of the anatolian block along the north anatolian fault and east anatolian faults dictates the current tectonic regime 19 which features enhanced subsidence in the black sea basin and significant volcanic activity in the anatolian region 20 it is these geological mechanisms which in the long term have caused the periodic isolations of the black sea from the rest of the global ocean system the modern basin is divided into two sub-basins by a convexity extending south from the crimean peninsula the large shelf to the north of the basin is up to 190km 120mi wide and features a shallow apron with gradients between 140 and 11000 the southern edge around turkey and the eastern edge around georgia however are typified by a narrow shelf that rarely exceeds 20km 12mi in width and a steep apron that is typically 140 gradient with numerous submarine canyons and channel extensions the euxine abyssal plain in the centre of the black sea reaches a maximum depth of 2212 metres 725722 feet just south of yalta on the crimean peninsula 21 the littoral zone of the black sea is often referred to as the pontic littoral or pontic zone 22 the area surrounding the black sea is commonly referred to as the black sea region its northern part lies within the chernozem belt black soil belt which goes from eastern croatia slavonia along the danube northern serbia northern bulgaria danubian plain and southern romania wallachian plain to northeast ukraine and further across the central black earth region and southern russia into siberia 23 hydrology edit the black sea is a marginal sea 24 and is the worlds largest body of water with a meromictic basin 25 the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere as a result over 90 of the deeper black sea volume is anoxic water 26 the black seas circulation patterns are primarily controlled by basin topography and fluvial inputs which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure because of the extreme stratification it is classified as a salt wedge estuary the black sea only experiences water transfer with the mediterranean sea so all inflow and outflow occurs in the bosphorus and dardanelles inflow from the mediterranean has a higher salinity and density than the outflow creating the classical estuarine circulation this means that inflow of dense water from the mediterranean occurs at the bottom of the basin while outflow of fresher black sea surface-water into the marmara sea occurs near the surface fresher surface water is the product of the fluvial inputs and this makes the black sea a positive sea the net input of freshwater creates an outflow volume about twice that of the inflow evaporation and precipitation are roughly equal at about 300 cubic kilometres per year 72cumia 24 because of the narrowness and shallowness of the bosphorus and dardanelles their respective depths are only 33 and 70 meters inflow and outflow current speeds are high and there is significant vertical shear this allows for turbulent mixing of the two layers 24 surface water leaves the black sea with a salinity of 17 psu and reaches the mediterranean with a salinity of 34 psu likewise inflow of the mediterranean with salinity 38.5 psu experiences a decrease to about 34 psu 24 mean surface circulation is cyclonic and waters around the perimeter of the black sea circulate in a basin-wide shelfbreak gyre known as the rim current the rim current has a maximum velocity of about 50100cms within this feature two smaller cyclonic gyres operate occupying the eastern and western sectors of the basin 24 the eastern and western gyres are well-organized systems in the winter but dissipate into a series of interconnected eddies in the summer and autumn mesoscale activity in the peripheral flow becomes more pronounced during these warmer seasons and is subject to interannual variability outside of the rim current numerous quasi-permanent coastal eddies are formed as a result of upwelling around the coastal apron and wind curl mechanisms the intra-annual strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations during the spring the batumi eddy forms in the southeastern corner of the sea 27 beneath the surface watersfrom about 50100 metersthere exists a halocline that stops at the cold intermediate layer cil this layer is composed of cool salty surface waters which are the result of localized atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months it is the remnant of the winter surface mixed layer 24 the base of the cil is marked by a major pycnocline at about 100200 metres 330660ft and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water below the pycnocline is the deep water mass where salinity increases to 22.3 psu and temperatures rise to around 89c 24 the hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilizes all of the free oxygen weak geothermal heating and long residence time create a very thick convective bottom layer 27 hydrochemistry edit because of the anoxic water at depth organic matter including anthropogenic artifacts such as boat hulls are well preserved during periods of high surface productivity short-lived algal blooms form organic rich layers known as sapropels scientists have reported an annual phytoplankton bloom that can be seen in many nasa images of the region 28 as a result of these characteristics the black sea has gained interest from the field of marine archaeology as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered such as the byzantine wreck sinop d located in the anoxic layer off the coast of sinop turkey modelling shows the release of the hydrogen sulfide clouds in the event of an asteroid impact into the black sea would pose a threat to healthor even lifefor people living on the black sea coast 29 there have been isolated reports of flares on the black sea occurring during thunderstorms possibly caused by lightning igniting combustible gas seeping up from the sea depths 30 ecology edit marine edit see also list of fish of the black sea the black sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem dominated by species suited to the brackish nutrient-rich conditions as with all marine food webs the black sea features a range of trophic groups with autotrophic algae including diatoms and dinoflagellates acting as primary producers the fluvial systems draining eurasia and central europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the black sea but distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification which is in turn dictated by seasonal physiographic development 31 during winter strong wind promotes convective overturning and upwelling of nutrients while high summer temperatures result in a marked vertical stratification and a warm shallow mixed layer 32 day length and insolation intensity also controls the extent of the photic zone subsurface productivity is limited by nutrient availability as the anoxic bottom waters act as a sink for reduced nitrate in the form of ammonia the benthic zone also plays an important role in black sea nutrient cycling as chemosynthetic organisms and anoxic geochemical pathways recycle nutrients which can be upwelled to the photic zone enhancing productivity 33 in total black seas biodiversity contains around one-third of mediterraneans and is experiencing natural and artificial invasions or mediterranizations 34 35 phytoplankton edit the main phytoplankton groups present in the black sea are dinoflagellates diatoms coccolithophores and cyanobacteria generally the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated spring production followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and a surface-intensified autumn production 32 36 this pattern of productivity is also augmented by an emiliania huxleyi bloom during the late spring and summer months dinoflagellates annual dinoflagellate distribution is defined by an extended bloom period in subsurface waters during the late spring and summer in november subsurface plankton production is combined with surface production due to vertical mixing of water masses and nutrients such as nitrite 31 the major bloom-forming dinoflagellate species in the black sea is gymnodinium sp 37 estimates of dinoflagellate diversity in the black sea range from 193 38 to 267 species 39 this level of species richness is relatively low in comparison to the mediterranean sea which is attributable to the brackish conditions low water transparency and presence of anoxic bottom waters it is also possible that the low winter temperatures below 4c 39f of the black sea prevent thermophilous species from becoming established the relatively high organic matter content of black sea surface water favour the development of heterotrophic an organism which uses organic carbon for growth and mixotrophic dinoflagellates species able to exploit different trophic pathways relative to autotrophs despite its unique hydrographic setting there are no confirmed endemic dinoflagellate species in the black sea 39 diatoms the black sea is populated by many species of marine diatom which commonly exist as colonies of unicellular non-motile auto and heterotrophic algae the life-cycle of most diatoms can be described as boom and bust and the black sea is no exception with diatom blooms occurring in surface waters throughout the year most reliably during march 31 in simple terms the phase of rapid population growth in diatoms is caused by the in-wash of silicon bearing terrestrial sediments and when the supply of silicon is exhausted the diatoms begin to sink out of the photic zone and produce resting cysts additional factors such as predation by zooplankton and ammonium based regenerated production also have a role to play in the annual diatom cycle 31 32 typically proboscia alata blooms during spring and pseudosolenia calcar-avis blooms during the autumn 37 coccolithophores coccolithophores are a type of motile autotrophic phytoplankton that produce caco 3 plates known as coccoliths as part of their life cycle in the black sea the main period of coccolithophore growth occurs after the bulk of the dinoflagellate growth has taken place in may the dinoflagellates move below the seasonal thermocline into deeper waters where more nutrients are available this permits coccolithophores to utilise the nutrients in the upper waters and by the end of may with favourable light and temperature conditions growth rates reach their highest the major bloom forming species is emiliania huxleyi which is also responsible for the release of dimethyl sulfide into the atmosphere overall coccolithophore diversity is low in the black sea and although recent sediments are dominated by e huxleyi braarudosphaera bigelowii holocene sediments have also been shown to contain helicopondosphaera and discolithina species cyanobacteria cyanobacteria are a phylum of picoplanktonic plankton ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.0 m bacteria that obtain their energy via photosynthesis and are present throughout the worlds oceans they exhibit a range of morphologiies including filamentous colonies and biofilms in the black sea several species are present and as an example synechococcus spp can be found throughout the photic zone although concentration decreases with increasing depth other factors which exert an influence on distribution include nutrient availability predation and salinity 40 animal species edit zebra mussel the black sea along with the caspian sea is part of the zebra mussels native range the mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world and become an invasive species where it has been introduced common carp the common carps native range extends to the black sea along with the caspian sea and aral sea like the zebra mussel the common carp is an invasive species when introduced to other habitats round goby is another native fish that is also found in the caspian sea it preys upon zebra mussels like the mussels and common carp it has become invasive when introduced to other environments like the great lakes marine mammals and marine megafaunas marine mammals present within the basin include two species of dolphins common 41 and bottlenose 42 and harbour porpoise 43 inhabit the sea although all of these are endangered due to pressures and impacts by human activities all the three species have been classified as a distinct subspecies from those in the mediterranean and in atlantic seas and endemic to black and azov seas and are more active during nights in turkish straits 44 however construction of the kerch strait bridge caused increases in nutrients and planktons in the waters attracting large numbers of fish and more than 1000 of bottlenose dolphins 45 on the other hand however others claim that construction may cause devastating damages on ecosystem including dolphins 46 critically endangered mediterranean monk seals were historically abundant in black sea and are regarded to have become extinct from the basin since in 1997 47 monk seals were present at the snake island until 1950s and several locations such as the danube plavni nature reserve ru and doankent were last of hauling-out sites in post-1990 48 very few animals still thrive in the sea of marmara 49 ongoing mediterranizations may or may not boost in increases of cetacean diversity in turkish straits 44 hence in black and azov basins various species of pinnipeds sea otter and beluga whales 50 51 were introduced into the black sea by mankind and later escaped either by accidental or purported causes of these grey seal 52 and beluga whales 50 have been recorded with successful long-term occurrences great white sharks are known to reach into the sea of marmara and bosphorus strait and basking shark into dardanelles although it is unclear whether or not these sharks may reach into the black and azov basins 53 54 ecological effects of pollution edit since the 1960s rapid industrial expansion along the black sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the npsi ratio in the basin in coastal areas the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5 and non-diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6 the non-diatoms such as the prymnesiophytes emiliania huxleyi coccolithophore chromulina sp and the euglenophyte eutreptia lanowii are able to out-compete diatom species because of the limited availability of si a necessary constituent of diatom frustules 55 as a consequence of these blooms benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine animals 56 57 the decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s while the invasive ctenophore mnemiopsis reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s additionally an alien speciesthe warty comb jelly mnemiopsis leidyi was able to establish itself in the basin exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric tons 58 the change in species composition in black sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry as ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and ph although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified in central black sea waters si levels were also significantly reduced due to a decrease in the flux of si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces this phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in black sea nutrient input to have basin-wide effects pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the black sea ecosystem during the 1990s and an eu monitoring exercise eros21 revealed decreased n and p values relative to the 1989 peak 59 recently scientists have noted signs of ecological recovery in part due to the construction of new sewage treatment plants in slovakia hungary romania and bulgaria in connection with membership in the european union mnemiopsis leidyi populations have been checked with the arrival of another alien species which feeds on them 60 jellyfish actinia actinia goby stingray goat fish hermit crab diogenes pugilator blue sponge spiny dogfish seahorse black sea common dolphins with a kite-surfer off sochi terrestrial edit in the past the range of the asiatic lion extended from south asia to the balkans possibly up to the danube places like turkey and the trans-caucasus were in this range the caspian tiger occurred in eastern turkey and the caucasus at least the lyuti zver old russian for fierce animal that was encountered by vladimir ii monomakh velikiy kniaz of kievan rus which ranged to the black sea in the south 61 may have been a tiger or leopard rather than a wolf or lynx due to the way it behaved towards him and his horse 62 climate edit short-term climatic variation in the black sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the north atlantic oscillation the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north atlantic and mid-latitude air masses 63 while the exact mechanisms causing the north atlantic oscillation remain unclear 64 it is thought the climate conditions established in western europe mediate the heat and precipitation fluxes reaching central europe and eurasia regulating the formation of winter cyclones which are largely responsible for regional precipitation inputs 65 and influence mediterranean sea surface temperatures ssts 66 the relative strength of these systems also limits the amount of cold air arriving from northern regions during winter 67 other influencing factors include the regional topography as depressions and storms systems arriving from the mediterranean are funneled through the low land around the bosphorus pontic and caucasus mountain ranges acting as wave guides limiting the speed and paths of cyclones passing through the region 68 islands edit there are some islands in the black sea that belong to bulgaria romania turkey and ukraine stthomas island bulgaria stanastasia island bulgaria stcyricus island bulgaria stivan island bulgaria stpeter island bulgaria sacalinu mare island romania sacalinu mic island romania novaya zemliya romania utrish island

sea is connected to the world ocean by a chain of two shallow straits the dardanelles and the bosphorus the dardanelles is 55m 180ft deep and the bosphorus is as shallow as 36m 118ft by comparison at the height of the last ice age sea levels were more than 100m 330ft lower than they are now there is also evidence that water levels in the black sea were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial period some researchers theorize that the black sea had been a landlocked freshwater lake at least in upper layers during the last glaciation and for some time after in the aftermath of the last glacial period water levels in the black sea and the aegean sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water the exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate one possibility is that the black sea filled first with excess fresh water flowing over the bosphorus sill and eventually into the mediterranean sea there are also catastrophic scenarios such as the black sea deluge theory put forward by william ryan walter pitman and petko dimitrov deluge hypothesis edit main article black sea deluge hypothesis the black sea deluge is a hypothesized catastrophic rise in the level of the black sea circa 5600 bc due to waters from the mediterranean sea breaching a sill in the bosporus strait the hypothesis was headlined when the new york times published it in december 1996 shortly before it was published in an academic journal 69 while it is agreed that the sequence of events described did occur there is debate over the suddenness dating and magnitude of the events relevant to the hypothesis is that its description has led some to connect this catastrophe with prehistoric flood myths 70 recorded history edit the black sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world the balkans to the west the eurasian steppes to the north caucasus and central asia to the east asia minor and mesopotamia to the south and greece to the south-west the oldest processed gold in the world was found in varna and the black sea was supposedly sailed by the argonauts the land at the eastern end of the black sea colchis now georgia marked for the greeks the edge of the known world the steppes to the north of the black sea have been suggested as the original homeland urheimat of the speakers of the proto-indo-european language pie the progenitor of the indo-european language family by some scholars such as marija gimbutas others move the heartland further east towards the caspian sea yet others to anatolia the black sea became an ottoman navy lake within five years of genoa losing the crimea in 1479 after which the only western merchant vessels to sail its waters were those of venice s old rival ragusa this restriction was gradually changed by the russian navy from 1783 until the relaxation of export controls in 1789 because of the french revolution 71 72 the black sea was a significant naval theatre of world war i and saw both naval and land battles during world war ii archaeology edit ancient trade routes in the region are currently when being extensively studied by scientists as the black sea was sailed by hittites carians colchians thracians greeks persians cimmerians scythians romans byzantines goths huns avars bulgars slavs varangians crusaders venetians genoese lithuanians georgians poles tatars ottomans and russians perhaps the most promising areas in deepwater archaeology are the quest for submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen this concentration of historical powers combined with the preservative qualities of the deep anoxic waters of the black sea has attracted increased interest from marine archaeologists who have begun to discover a large number of ancient ships and organic remains in a high state of preservation modern use edit commercial and civic use edit according to nato the black sea is a strategic corridor that provides smuggling channels for moving legal and illegal goods including drugs radioactive materials and counterfeit goods that can be used to finance terrorism 73 navigation edit ports and ferry terminals edit according to the international transport workers federation 2013 study there were at least 30 operating merchant seaports in the black sea including at least 12 in ukraine 74 merchant fleet and traffic edit according to the international transport workers federation 2013 study there were around 2400 commercial vessels operating in the black sea 74 fishing edit anchovy the turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300000 tons per year on average and fishery carried out mainly in winter and the highest portion of the stock is caught between november and december 75 hydrocarbons exploration edit since the 1980s the soviet union started offshore drilling for petroleum in the seas western portion adjoining ukraine s coast the independent ukraine continued and intensified that effort within its exclusive economic zone inviting major international oil companies for exploration discovery of the new massive oilfields in the area stimulated an influx of foreign investments it also provoked a short-term peaceful territorial dispute with romania which was resolved in 2011 by an international court redefining the exclusive economic zones between the two countries holiday resorts and spas edit in the years following the end of the cold war the popularity of the
