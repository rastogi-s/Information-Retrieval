micrometeorite wikipedia micrometeorite a micrometeorite is essentially a micrometeoroid that has survived entry through earths atmosphere the size of such a particle ranges from 50 m to 2 mm usually found on earth s surface micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they are smaller in size more abundant and different in composition they are a subset of cosmic dust which also includes the smaller interplanetary dust particles idps 1 micrometeorites enter earths atmosphere at high velocities at least 11 kms and undergo heating through atmospheric friction and compression micrometeorites individually weigh between 10 9 and 10 4 g and collectively comprise most of the extraterrestrial material that has come to the present-day earth 2 fred lawrence whipple first coined the term micro-meteorite to describe dust-sized objects that fall to the earth 3 sometimes meteoroids and micrometeoroids entering the earths atmosphere are visible as meteors or shooting stars whether or not they reach the ground and survive as meteorites and micrometorites introduction edit micrometeorite mm textures vary as their original structural and mineral compositions are modified by the degree of heating that they experience entering the atmospherea function of their initial speed and angle of entry they range from unmelted particles that retain their original mineralogy fig 1 a b to partially melted particles fig 1 c d to round melted cosmic spherules fig 1 e f g h fig 2 some of which have lost a large portion of their mass through vaporization fig 1 i classification is based on composition and degree of heating 4 5 the extraterrestrial origins of micrometeorites are determined by microanalyses that show that the metal they contain is similar to that found in meteorites 6 some have wstite a high-temperature iron oxide found in meteorite fusion crusts 7 their silicate minerals have major and trace elements ratios similar to those in meteorites 8 9 the abundances of cosmogenic manganese 53 mn in iron spherules and of cosmogenic beryllium 10 be aluminum 26 al and solar neon isotope in stony mms are extraterrestrial 10 11 the presence of pre-solar grains in some mms 12 and deuterium excesses in ultra-carbonaceous mms 13 indicates that they are not only extraterrestrial but that some of their components formed before our solar system an estimated 30000 20000 tonnes per year tyr 2 of cosmic dust enters the upper atmosphere each year of which less than 10 2700 1400tyr is estimated to reach the surface as particles 14 therefore the mass of micrometeorites deposited is roughly 50 times higher than that estimated for meteorites which represent approximately 50 tyr 15 and the huge number of particles entering the atmosphere each year 10 17 10m suggests that large mm collections contain particles from all dust producing objects in the solar system including asteroids comets and fragments from our moon and mars large mm collections provide information on the size composition atmospheric heating effects and types of materials accreting on earth while detailed studies of individual mms give insights into their origin the nature of the carbon amino acids and pre-solar grains they contain 16 collection sites edit micrometeorites have been collected from deep-sea sediments sedimentary rocks and polar sediments they are currently collected primarily from polar snow and ice because of their low concentrations on the earths surface mms are sought in environments that concentrate these materials relative to terrestrial particles ocean sediments edit melted micrometeorites cosmic spherules were first collected from deep-sea sediments during the 1873 to 1876 expedition of the hms challenger in 1891 murray and renard found two groups of micrometeorites first black magnetic spherules with or without a metallic nucleus second brown-coloured spherules resembling chondrules with a crystalline structure 17 in 1883 they suggested that these spherules were extraterrestrial because they were found far from terrestrial particle sources they did not resemble magnetic spheres produced in furnaces of the time and their nickel-iron fe-ni metal cores did not resemble metallic iron found in volcanic rocks the spherules were most abundant in slowly accumulating sediments particularly red clays deposited below the carbonate compensation depth a finding that supported a meteoritic origin 18 in addition to those spheres with fe-ni metal cores some spherules larger than 300m contain a core of elements from the platinum group 19 since the first collection of the hms challenger cosmic spherules have been recovered from ocean sediments using cores box cores clamshell grabbers and magnetic sleds 20 among these a magnetic sled called the cosmic muck rake retrieved thousands of cosmic spherules from the top 10cm of red clays on the pacific ocean floor 21 terrestrial sediments edit terrestrial sediments also contain micrometeorites these have been found in samples that have low sedimentation rates such as claystones 22 and hardgrounds 23 24 are easily dissolved such as salt deposits 25 and limestones 26 have been mass sorted such as heavy mineral concentrates found in deserts 27 and beach sands 7 the oldest mms are totally altered iron spherules found in 140 to 180-million-year-old hardgrounds 23 amateur collectors may find micrometeorites in areas where dirt and dust from a large area has been concentrated such as from a roof downspout 28 polar depositions edit micrometeorites found in polar sediments are much less weathered than those found in other terrestrial environments as evidenced by little etching of interstitial glass and the presence of large numbers of glass spherules and unmelted micrometeorites particle types that are rare or absent in deep-sea samples 4 the mms found in polar regions have been collected from greenland snow 29 greenland cryoconite 30 31 32 antarctic blue ice 33 antarctic aeolian wind-driven debris 34 35 36 ice cores 37 the bottom of the south pole water well 4 14 antarctic sediment traps 38 and present day antarctic snow 13 classification and origins of micrometeorites edit classification edit modern classification of meteorites and micrometeorites is complex the 2007 review paper of krot et al 39 summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy linking individual micrometeorites to meteorite classification groups requires a comparison of their elemental isotopic and textural characteristics 40 comet vs asteroid origin of micrometeorites edit whereas most meteorites likely originate from asteroids the contrasting makeup of micrometeorites suggests that most originate from comets fewer than 1 of mms are achondritic and are similar to hed meteorites which are thought to be from the asteroid 4 vesta 41 42 most mms are compositionally similar to carbonaceous chondrites 43 44 45 whereas approximately 3 of meteorites are of this type 46 the dominance of carbonaceous chondrite-like mms and their low abundance in meteorite collections suggests that most mms derive from sources different than those for most meteorites since most meteorites probably derive from asteroids an alternative source for mms might be comets the idea that mms might originate from comets originated in 1950 3 until recently the greater-than-25-kms entry velocities of micrometeoroids measured for particles from comet streams cast doubts against their survival as mms 10 47 however recent dynamical simulations 48 suggest that 85 of cosmic dust could be cometary furthermore analyses of particles returned from the comet wild 2 by the stardust spacecraft show that these particles have compositions that are consistent with many micrometeorites 49 50 nonetheless some parent bodies of micrometeorites appear to be asteroids with chondrule bearing carbonaceous chondrites 51 extraterrestrial micrometeorites edit the influx of micrometeoroids also contributes to the composition of regolith planetarylunar soil on other bodies in the solar system mars has an estimated annual micrometeoroid influx of between 2700 and 59000tyr this contributes to about 1m of micrometeoritic content to the depth of the martian regolith every billion years measurements from the viking program indicate that the martian regolith is composed of 60 basaltic rock and 40 rock of meteoritic origin the lower-density martian atmosphere allows much larger particles than on earth to survive the passage through to the surface largely unaltered until impact while on earth particles that survive entry typically have undergone significant transformation a significant fraction of particles entering the martian atmosphere throughout the 60 to 1200-m diameter range probably survive unmelted 52
