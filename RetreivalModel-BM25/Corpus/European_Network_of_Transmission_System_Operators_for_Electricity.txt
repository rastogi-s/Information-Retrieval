european network of transmission system operators for electricity wikipedia european network of transmission system operators for electricity entso-e the european network of transmission system operators represents 43 electricity transmission system operators tsos from 36 countries across europe thus extending beyond eu borders entso-e was established and given legal mandates by the eus third package for the internal energy market in 2009 which aims at further liberalising the gas and electricity markets in the eu 1 history edit on 27 june 2008 36european electricity transmission system operators tsos signed in prague a declaration of intent to create the entso-e 2 entso-e was established on 19 december 2008 in brussels by 42tsos as a successor of six regional associations of the electricity transmission system operators 3 4 entso-e became operational on 1 july 2009 the former associations etso atsoi uktsoa nordel ucte and baltso became a part of the entso-e while still offering data by their predecessors for public interest 5 creation of entso-e was initiated by the adoption of the european union third legislative package on the gas and electricity markets 2 in 2003 the european commission conducted a sector inquiry concerning the competition of electricity market in six european countries 6 examining competition in these countries the final report stated serious issues to be solved 7 it was noticed that the integration between member states markets is still insufficient additionally the absence of transparently available market information was assessed 6 as a result the third legislative package on the eu gas and electricity markets was adopted by the european commission in september 2007 8 objectives edit according to its website entso-e promotes closer cooperation across europes tsos to support the implementation of eu energy policy and achieve europes energy climate policy objectives which are changing the very nature of the power system the main objectives of entso-e centre on the integration of renewable energy sources res such as wind and solar power into the power system and the completion of the internal energy market iem which is central to meeting the european unions energy policy objectives of affordability sustainability and security of supply entso-e aims to be the focal point for all technical market and policy issues relating to tsos and the european network interfacing with power system users eu institutions regulators and national governments 1 members edit tsos are responsible for the bulk transmission of electric power on the main high voltage electric networks tsos provide grid access to the electricity market players ie generating companies traders suppliers distributors and directly connected customers according to non-discriminatory and transparent rules in many countries tsos are in charge of the development of the grid infrastructure too tsos in the european union internal electricity market are entities operating independently from the other electricity market players unbundling 9 entso-e contains 43 tsos from 36 countries 10 geographical area edit the geographical area covered by entso-es member tsos is divided into five synchronous areas and two isolated systems cyprus and iceland synchronous areas are groups of countries that are connected via their respective power systems the system frequency 50hz with usually very minor deviations is synchronous within each area and a disturbance at one single point in the area will be registered across the entire zone individual synchronous areas are interconnected through direct current interconnectors the benefits of synchronous areas include pooling of generation capacities common provisioning of reserves both resulting in cost-savings and mutual assistance in the event of disturbances resulting in cheaper reserve power costs for instance in case of a disturbance or outage 11 legal basis edit the third energy package and regulation ec no 7142009 12 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity regulation stipulate entso-es tasks and responsibilities regulation eu 8382010 13 on guidelines relating to the inter-tso compensation mechanism sets out the methodology by which tsos receive compensation for the costs incurred in hosting cross-border flows of electricity regulation eu 3472013 14 on guidelines for trans-european energy infrastructure defines european projects of common interest pcis 15 identifies entso-es ten-year network development plan tyndp 16 as the basis for the selection of pcis entso-e is also mandated to develop a corresponding costbenefit methodology 17 for the assessment of transmission infrastructure projects the transparency regulation eu no 5432013 18 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets makes it mandatory for european member state data providers and owners to submit fundamental information related to electricity generation load transmission balancing outages and congestion management for publication through the entso-e transparency platform 11 key activities edit pan-european transmission network plans and costbenefit analysis edit the ten-year network development plan 2016 tyndp 19 is drafted by entso-e in close cooperation with stakeholders under scrutiny of acer and is finally adopted by the european commission it is the only existing pan-european network development plan it is the basis for the selection of eu projects of common interest pcis 20 the list of pcis is not fixed by entso-e and is subject to a different process led by the european commission and eu member states the tyndp is updated every two years for inclusion in the tyndp each project whether transmission or storage has to go through a costbenefit analysis the benefit analysis methodology 17 is developed by entso-e in consultation with stakeholders and adopted by the european commission it assesses projects against socio-economic and environmental criteria 11 adequacy forecasts edit entso-e publishes summer and winter generation outlooks 21 well as a long-term system adequacy forecast the scenario outlook adequacy forecast soaf 22 the seasonal outlooks assess if there is enough generation to cover supply and highlight possibilities for neighbouring countries to contribute to the generationdemand balance in critical situations in a specific country the soaf analyses system adequacy on the long-term and is connected to investment decisions 11 network codes edit entso-es network codes are binding pan-european rules drafted by entso-e in consultation with stakeholders with guidance from acer network codes are grouped in three areas connection codes connecting electricity generators demand and direct current lines to the transmission grids operational codes governing how the pan-european electricity systems are operated and market codes facilitating and harmonising electricity trading across european borders 11 23 the drafting and adoption process of network codes is defined by the third package acer develops a framework guideline setting the policy choices for each code on this basis the codes are drafted by entso-e in consultation with stakeholders after acers opinion and recommendation for adoption each code is submitted to the european commission for approval through the comitology process ie to be voted on by member state representatives and thus to become eu law directly binding and implemented across all member states 11 transparency platform tp edit entso-es central information transparency platform 24 provides free access to fundamental data and information on pan-european wholesale energy generation transmission and consumption research development and innovation rdi edit entso-es rd roadmap 25 provides the entso-e vision on grid projects to be carried out by tsos to meet eu objectives the roadmap is supported by the annual rd implementation plan 26 which combines both top-down and bottom-up approaches in meeting the requirements of the roadmap entso-e publishes annually a rd monitoring report 27 that assesses the progress of tso-related rd work 11 governance edit entso-e is an international non-profit association aisbl established according to belgian law entso-e is financed by its members the tsos contribute to the budget according to the number of countries and the population served 11 the highest body of entso-e is the assembly which is composed of representatives at ceo level of all the currently 43 members the entso-e board is elected every two years from the overall membership and through the assembly it includes 12 representatives the president vice president and committee chairs are invited to board meetings the board coordinates the committees and lrg work and implements assembly decisions 11 28 entso-e has established four specialized committees 29 composed of managers from member tsos each committee leads a number of regional groups and working groups at the same level as the four committees the transversal legal regulatory group 30 advises all entso-e bodies on legal and regulatory issues in addition expert groups on data network codes implementation and eu affairs provide specific expertise and work products to the association 11 entso-es secretariat is based in brussels it is headed by the secretary-general and represents entso-e to the european institutions regulators and stakeholders organizational chart edit key figures 2014 edit 41 transmission system operators 34 european countries
