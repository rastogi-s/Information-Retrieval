of yugoslavia fr yugoslavia or fry savezna republika jugoslavija 2 a name which the union held until february 2003 the state aspired to be recognized as the sole legal successor to yugoslavia but those claims were opposed by other former constituent republics the united nations also denied its request to take up yugoslavias membership 3 eventually after the overthrow of slobodan miloevi from power as president of the federation in 2000 the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the badinter arbitration committee about shared succession it re-applied for un membership on 27 october and was admitted on 1 november 2000 4 the fry was initially dominated by slobodan miloevi as president of serbia 19891997 and then president of yugoslavia 19972000 5 miloevi installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents such as dobrica osi and prime ministers such as milan pani 5 however the montenegrin government initially enthusiastic supporters of miloevi started gradually distancing themselves from his policies that culminated in regime change in 1996 when his former ally milo ukanovi reversed his policies became leader of montenegros ruling party and subsequently dismissed former montenegrin leader momir bulatovi who remained loyal to the miloevi government as bulatovi was given central positions in belgrade from that time as federal

symbolism the red star was removed from the national flag and the communist coat of arms was replaced by a white double-headed eagle with the arms of both serbia and montenegro within it the new state also established the office of the president held by a single person initially appointed with the consent of the republics of serbia and montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected foundation edit with the collapse of yugoslavia and its institutions from 1991 to 1992 the issue of unity of the two republics remaining in the collapsing federation serbia montenegro as well as serb-majority territories in croatia and bosnia that wished to remain united became an issue in 1991 diplomatic talks chaired by lord carrington with the leaders of the six republics of the collapsing federation resulted in all the republics except for serbia agreeing that yugoslavia had collapsed and that each republic should become an independent state the serbian government was surprised and outraged by montenegros decision in favour of terminating yugoslavia as the bulatovic government had previously been closely allied with milosevics government in serbia citation needed yugoslavias collapse began in 1991 when slovenia croatia and the republic of macedonia declared independence on 26 december 1991 serbia montenegro and the serb rebel-held territories in croatia agreed that they would form a new third yugoslavia 6 efforts were also made in 1991 to include sr bosnia and herzegovina within the federation with negotiations between miloevic bosnias serbian democratic party and the bosniak proponent of union bosnias vice-president adil zulfikarpai taking place on this matter 7 zulfikarpai believed that bosnia could benefit from a union with serbia montenegro and krajina thus he supported a union which would secure the unity of serbs and bosniaks 7 miloevic continued negotiations with zulfikarpai to include bosnia within a new yugoslavia however efforts to include the whole of bosnia within a new yugoslavia effectively terminated by late 1991 as izetbegovi planned to hold a referendum on independence while the bosnian serbs and bosnian croats formed autonomous territories 7 yugoslav wars edit main article yugoslav wars the fry was suspended from a number of international institutions this was due to the ongoing yugoslav wars during the 1990s which had prevented agreement being reached on the disposition of federal assets and liabilities particularly the national debt the government of yugoslavia supported croatian and bosnian serbs in the wars from 1992 to 1995 because of that the country was under economic and political sanctions which resulted in economic disaster that forced thousands of its young citizens to emigrate from the country in a bbc documentary called the death of yugoslavia and later in his testimony before the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia during the trial of slobodan miloevi yugoslav official borisav jovi revealed that the bosnian serb army arose from the yugoslav army forces in bosnia and herzegovina he claimed that he had realized that bosnia and herzegovina was about to be recognized by the international community and since yugoslav peoples army troops were still located there at that point their presence on bosnian territory could have led to the federal republic of yugoslavia being accused of aggression to avoid this he and miloevi decided to move all jna soldiers originating from serbia and montenegro back into serbia and montenegro and to move all jna soldiers of bosnian serb descent to bosnia and herzegovina 8 in this way every bosnian serb was transferred from the yugoslav army to what became the newly created bosnian serb army through this the bosnian serb army also received extensive military equipment and full funding from the fry as the bosnian serb faction alone could not pay for the costs 8 furthermore serbian radical party founder and paramilitary vojislav eelj claimed that president miloevi personally asked him to send paramilitaries into bosnia and herzegovina 8 in 1995 serbian president slobodan miloevi represented the fry and bosnian serbs at peace talks in dayton ohio us which negotiated the end of war in bosnia with the dayton agreement growing separatism edit montenegro edit from 1996 the first public signs of political discord between parts of montenegrin leadership and the serbian leadership began to appear by 1998 simultaneously with montenegrin prime minister milo ukanovi coming out on top in the power struggle with montenegrin president momir bulatovi the republic undertook a different economic policy by adopting the deutsche mark as its currency during autumn 1999 following the kosovo war and the nato bombing campaign ukanovi who by now firmly held power in montenegro as bulatovi was completely squeezed out drafted a document called platforma za redefiniciju odnosa crne gore i srbije a platform for redefinition of relations within the federal republic of yugoslavia calling for major changes in the division of governing responsibilities within fr yugoslavia though still officially seeing montenegro within a joint state with serbia miloevi did not respond to the platform considering it unconstitutional political relations within the federal state became more and more strained especially against the backdrop of the wave of assassinations against top figures from political criminal and state business circles in both republics eljko arkan ranatovi pavle bulatovi ika petrovi and goran ugi as well as two attempts on the life of opposition politician vuk drakovi by october 2000 miloevi had lost power in serbia contrary to expectation ukanovis response to the power change in belgrade was not to further push the agenda outlined in his platform but instead to suddenly start pushing for full independence thus completely dropping the platform in the process subsequent governments of montenegro carried out pro-independence policies and political tensions with serbia simmered despite political changes in belgrade kosovo war edit main article kosovo war with miloevis second and last legal term as serbian president expiring in 1997 he ran for and was elected president of yugoslavia in 1997 upon taking office miloevi gained direct control of the

kotunica took over as yugoslav president and remained president until the states reconstitution as the state union of serbia and montenegro federal prime minister milan pani became frustrated with miloevis domineering behaviour during diplomatic talks in 1992 and told miloevi to shut up because miloevis position was officially subordinate to his position 14 miloevi later forced pani to resign 15 however this situation changed after 1997 when miloevis second and last legal term as serbian president ended he then had himself elected federal president thus entrenching the power that he

from federal control and from serbia during the miloevi era afterwards the two republics had separate central banks whilst montenegro began to use different currencies it first adopted the deutsch mark and continued to use it until the mark fell into disuse to be replaced by the euro serbia continued to use the yugoslav dinar renaming it the serbian dinar the complexity of the frys political relationships slow progress in privatisation and stagnation in the european economy were detrimental to the economy arrangements with the imf especially requirements for fiscal discipline were an

only in montenegro 13 july statehood day non-working proposed flag and anthem edit after the formation of serbia and montenegro the yugoslav tricolour was to be replaced by a new compromise flag article 23 of the law for the implementation of the constitutional charter 17 stated that a law specifying the new flag was to be passed within 60 days of the first session of the new joint parliament among the flag proposals the popular choice was a flag with a shade of blue in between the serbian tricolour and the montenegrin tricolour of 19932004 the colour shade pantone 300c was perceived as the best choice 18 however the parliament failed to vote on the proposal within the legal time-frame and the flag was not adopted in 2004 montenegro adopted a radically different flag as its independence-leaning government sought to distance itself from serbia proposals for a compromise flag were dropped after this and the union of serbia and montenegro never adopted a flag a similar fate befell the countrys anthem and coat-of-arms to be the above-mentioned article 23 also stipulated that a law determining the state unions flag and anthem was to be passed by the end of 2003 the official proposal for an anthem was a combination piece consisting of one verse of the serbian anthem boe pravde followed by a verse of the montenegrin anthem oj svijetla majska zoro this proposal was dropped after some public opposition notably by serbian patriarch pavle 19 another legal deadline passed and no anthem was adopted serious proposals for the coat of arms were never put forward probably because the coat of arms of the fry adopted in 1994 combining serbian and montenegrin heraldic elements was considered adequate thus the state union never officially adopted state symbols and continued to use the flag and anthem of the federal republic of yugoslavia by inertia until its dissolution in 2006 sports edit football edit main article football association of serbia and montenegro

fifa world cups in 1998 as fr yugoslavia and in 2006 as serbia and montenegro it also qualified for euro 2000 the 1998 world cup appearance in france was accompanied with plenty of expectation and quiet confidence as the team was considered to be one of the tournaments dark horses due to being stacked with proven world-class players such as 29-year-old predrag mijatovi 33-year-old dragan stojkovi 29-year-old sinia mihajlovi 28-year-old vladimir jugovi and 31-year-old dejan savievi as well as emerging 19-year-old youngster dejan stankovi and tall 24-year-old target forwards savo miloevi and darko kovaevi another reason for heightened expectations was the fact this was the countrys first major international appearance following the un-imposed exile however the talented squad never managed to hit top gearalthough it did make it out of the group it got eliminated by the netherlands via an injury-time goal in the round-of-16 two years later at euro 2000 virtually the same
