one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute 318 the system which became known as content id 319 creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found 320 when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file 320 content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube 321 an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible 322 the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use 323 if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision 324 prior to 2016 videos werent monetized until the dispute was resolved

commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtubes system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating we have strict rules on whats allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 247 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly 330 july 2008 in october 2010 us congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki 331 youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the sites guidelines 332 in december

what may be incorporated into videos being monetized this includes strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creators intent is to inform or entertain 335 in september 2016 after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations youtubes policies were criticized by prominent users including phillip defranco and vlogbrothers

improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators 336 337 338 in march 2017 the government of the united kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from youtube

begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear 339 340 in early-april 2017 the youtube channel h3h3productions presented evidence claiming that a wall street journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing johnny rebel music overlaid on a chief keef music video citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader the video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video 341 342 on april 6 2017 youtube announced that in order to ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review and have at least 10000 lifetime views before they may join the partner program 343 child protection see also daddyofive and elsagate in 2017 youtube was associated with several controversies related to child safety during q2 the owners of popular channel daddyofive which featured themselves playing pranks on their children

inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent sexual or otherwise disturbing situations many of which appeared on youtube kids and attracted millions of views the term elsagate was coined on the internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy 348 349 350 351 on november 11 2017 youtube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content later that month the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters as part as a broader concern regarding child safety on youtube the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults most notably the company removed toy freaks a channel with over 85million subscribers that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations 352 353 354 355 356 357 according to analytics specialist socialblade it earned up to 87million annually prior to its deletion 358 also in november 2017 it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children often uploaded by the minors themselves and showing innocent content were attracting comments from pedophiles 359 360 and circulating on the dark web with predators finding the videos by typing in certain keywords in russian 360 as a result of the controversy which added to the concern about elsagate several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on youtube 361 351 user comments see also criticism of google youtube user comments most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred 362 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as 363 juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance with the occasional burst of wit shining through in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts 364 the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult 365 on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone 366 the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse 367 368 in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change 369 the official youtube announcement 370 received 20097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32000 comments in two days 371 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say 372 perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isnt so bad think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube 373 on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments 374 creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam they can also allow other users to moderate their comments 375 view counts in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the sites terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube 376
