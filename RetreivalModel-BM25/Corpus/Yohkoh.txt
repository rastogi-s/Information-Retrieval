yohkoh wikipedia yohkoh yohkoh sunbeam in japanese known before launch as solar-a was a solar observatory spacecraft of the institute of space and astronautical science japan in collaboration with space agencies in the united states and the united kingdom it was launched into earth orbit on august30 1991 by the m-3s-5 rocket from kagoshima space center it took its first soft x-ray image on september 13 1991 215340 1 and movie representations of the x-ray corona over 1991-2001 are available at the yohkoh legacy site description edit the satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit it carried four instruments a soft x-ray telescope sxt a hard x-ray telescope hxt a bragg crystal spectrometer bcs and a wide band spectrometer wbs about 50 mb were generated each day and stored on board by a 10.5 mb bubble memory recorder because sxt utilized a charge-coupled device ccd as its readout device perhaps being the first x-ray astronomical telescope to do so its data cube of images was both extensive and convenient and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona previous solar soft x-ray observations such as those of skylab had been restricted to film as a readout device yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity 2 the mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its safehold mode during an annular eclipse on december 14 2001 205833 and the spacecraft lost lock on the sun operational mistakes and other flaws combined in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries which drained irreversibly several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed on september 12 2005 the spacecraft burned up during reentry over south asia the time of reentry as provided by the us space surveillance network was 616 pm japan standard time jst instruments edit yohkoh carried four instruments 3 the soft x-ray telescope sxt 4 was an x-ray telescope with glancing incidence x-ray mirror and a ccd sensor there was also a co-aligned optical telescope using the same ccd but after the failure of the entrance filter in november 1992 it became unusable the ccd was 10241024 pixels with pixel angular size of 245245 a point-spread function core width fwhm of about 1.5 pixels ie 37 a field of view of 4242 which was a little larger than the whole solar disk typical time resolution was 2s in flare mode and 8s in quiet no flare mode the maximum time resolution in 05s for spectral discrimination stx employed wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel there were five usable filter positions 1265 thick al filter 2536 pass band almgmn filter 2432 252m mg filter 2423 116m al filter 2413 119m be filter 2310 before the entrance filter failure in november 1992 three more filter positions were available no analysis filter 2546 wide band optical filter 46004800 narrow band optical filter 42904320 the hard x-ray telescope hxt 5 was a fourier-synthesis x-ray imager with 64 bigrid collimators sparsely sampling the uv plane and feeding individual scintillation-counter detectors hxt was sensitive to photons with energies from 14kev to 93kev this range was divided into four energy bands called l m1 m2h the angular resolution was about 5 image synthesis field of view is 22 maximum time resolution was 05s bragg crystal spectrometer bcs was two bent crystal spectrometers sensitive in four spectral lines the line of ion fexxvi 176181 ion fexxv 183190 ion caxix 316319 and ion sxv 502511 spectral resolution varied in the range of 30008000 typical time resolution in flare mode was 8s maximum is 0125s bcs integrates radiation over the whole solar disc wide band spectrometer wbs had spectroscopic capabilities in a wide energy band from 3kev to 100mev wbs was a set of four subinstruments ech of them outputs pulse count pc corresponding to intensity integrated over a band and pulse height ph profile which corresponded to spectrum time resolution for pc 0125s4s for different subinstruments and modes was 816 times better than for ph 1s32s wbs integrated radiation over the whole sun and did not resolve source position soft x-ray spectrometer sxs consisted of two proportional gas counters with nominal energy band 5kev40kev which was divided into two pc channels and 128 ph channels it was found after the launch that ph to energy relationship was distorted no energy calibration for wbs ph data was available in 1999 hard x-ray spectrometer hxs was a naitl scintillator the energy band after june 1992 was 24kev830kev it was divided into 2 pc channels and 32 ph channels gamma-ray spectrometer grs consisted of two identical bismuth germanate oxide scintillators it covered energy range 03mev100mev which was divided into 6 pc channels and 12816 ph channels radiation belt monitor rbm unlike the other three was not aimed at solar flare observations and served to sound the alarm for radiation belt passage
