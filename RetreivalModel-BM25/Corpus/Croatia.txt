the hungarian forces in 1849 and ushering a period of germanization policy 41 by the 1860s failure of the policy became apparent leading to the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the austrian empire and the kingdom of hungary the treaty left the issue of croatias status to hungary and the status was resolved by the croatianhungarian settlement of 1868 when kingdoms of croatia and slavonia were united 42 the kingdom of dalmatia remained under de facto austrian control while rijeka retained the status of corpus separatum introduced

country as a unitary state and abolition of croatian parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended croatian autonomy the new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political partythe croatian peasant party hss led by stjepan radi 47 the political situation deteriorated further as radi was assassinated in the national assembly in 1928 leading to the dictatorship of king alexander in january 1929 48 the dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution and changed the name of the country to yugoslavia 49 the hss now led by vladko maek continued to advocate federalisation of yugoslavia resulting in the cvetkovimaek agreement of august 1939 and the autonomous banovina of croatia the yugoslav

nazi-backed puppet state parts of dalmatia were annexed by italy and the northern croatian regions of baranja and meimurje were annexed by hungary 51 the ndh regime was led by ante paveli and ultranationalist ustae the regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against serb and roma inhabitants of the ndh exemplified by the jasenovac and stara gradika concentration camps 52 it is estimated that out of 39000 jews in the country only 9000 survived the rest were either killed or deported to germany both by the local authorities and the german army itself 53 croatian and serbian sources disagree on the exact figures 54 furthermore a significant number of serbs were killed by the ustae on the territory of the ndh during the war according to midlarsky the number of serbs killed by the regime was at least half a million 55 but the figure is contradicted by bogoljub koovi and vladimir erjavi koovi estimated the total number of serbs killed throughout yugoslav territory in various circumstances at 487000 while erjavi put the figure at 530000 erjavi indicated that 320000 serbs were killed in the ndh including 82000 killed among the yugoslav partisans 23000 killed as axis collaborators 25000 victims of a typhoid epidemic 45000 killed by germans and 15000 by italians koovis and erjavis total yugoslav losses are in agreement with estimates made by mayers and campbell of the united states census bureau 56 the number of croats killed in the ndh is estimated to be approximately 200000 either by the croatian fascist regime as members of the armed resistance or as axis collaborators 54 57 several thousand of these were killed by the chetniks most croatian historians place the number of croats killed by the chetniks on the territory of modern-day croatia at between 3000 and 3500 croatian estimates for the number of croats killed by chetniks in the whole of yugoslavia range from 18000 to 32000 both combatants and civilians 58 a resistance movement soon emerged on 22 june 1941 59 the 1st sisak partisan detachment was formed near sisak as the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied europe 60 this sparked the beginning of the yugoslav partisan movement a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by josip broz tito 61 the movement grew rapidly and at the tehran conference in december 1943 the partisans gained recognition from the allies 62 with allied support in logistics equipment training and air power and with the assistance of soviet troops taking part in the 1944 belgrade offensive the partisans gained control of yugoslavia and the border regions of italy and austria by may 1945 during which thousands of members of the ustae as well as croat refugees were killed by the yugoslav partisans 63 the political aspirations of the partisan movement were reflected in the state anti-fascist council for the national liberation of croatia which developed in 1943 as the bearer of croatian statehood and later transformed into the parliament of croatia in 1945 and avnoj its counterpart at the yugoslav level 64 65 after world war ii croatia

declaration on the status and name of the croatian standard language demanding greater autonomy for croatian language 66 the declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the yugoslav economy culminating in the croatian spring of 1971 suppressed by yugoslav leadership 67 still the 1974 yugoslav constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units basically fulfilling a goal of the croatian spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents 68 following the death of yugoslav president josip broz tito in 1980 the political situation in yugoslavia deteriorated with national tension fanned by the 1986 serbian sanu memorandum and the 1989 coups in vojvodina kosovo and montenegro 69 70 in january 1990 the
