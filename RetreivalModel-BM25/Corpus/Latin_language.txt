latin wikipedia latin for other uses see latin disambiguation latin latin lingua latna ipa la latina is a classical language belonging to the italic branch of the indo-european languages the latin alphabet is derived from the etruscan and greek alphabets and ultimately from the phoenician alphabet latin was originally spoken in latium in the italian peninsula 3 through the power of the roman republic it became the dominant language initially in italy and subsequently throughout the roman empire vulgar latin developed into the romance languages such as italian portuguese spanish french and romanian latin greek and french have contributed many words to the english language latin and ancient greek roots are used in theology biology and medicine by the late roman republic 75 bc old latin had been standardised into classical latin vulgar latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like plautus and terence 4 late latin is the written language from the 3rd century and medieval latin the language used from the 9th century to the renaissance which used renaissance latin later early modern latin and modern latin evolved latin was used as the language of international communication scholarship and science until well into the 18th century when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ecclesiastical latin remains the official language of the holy see and the roman rite of the catholic church latin is taught in primary secondary and postsecondary educational institutions around the world 5 6 latin is a highly inflected language with three distinct genders seven noun cases four verb conjugations four verb principal parts six tenses three persons three moods two voices two aspects and two numbers history edit main article history of latin a number of historical phases of the language have been recognised each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary usage spelling morphology and syntax there are no hard and fast rules of classification different scholars emphasise different features as a result the list has variants as well as alternative names in addition to the historical phases ecclesiastical latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the roman catholic church as well as by protestant scholars from late antiquity onward after the western roman empire fell in 476 and germanic kingdoms took its place the germanic people adopted latin as a language more suitable for legal and other more formal uses citation needed old latin edit main article old latin the earliest known form of latin is old latin which was spoken from the roman kingdom to the later part of the roman republic period it is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant latin literary works such as the comedies of plautus and terence the latin alphabet was devised from the etruscan alphabet the writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a boustrophedon 7 8 script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script 9 classical latin edit main article classical latin during the late republic and into the first years of the empire a new classical latin arose a conscious creation of the orators poets historians and other literate men who wrote the great works of classical literature which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools todays instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech 10 11 vulgar latin edit main articles vulgar latin and late latin philological analysis of archaic latin works such as those of plautus which contain snippets of everyday speech indicates that a spoken language vulgar latin termed sermo vulgi the speech of the masses by cicero existed concurrently with literate classical latin the informal language was rarely written so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti 12 as it was free to develop on its own there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically on the contrary romanised european populations developed their own dialects of the language which eventually led to the differentiation of romance languages 13 the decline of the roman empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about late latin a postclassical stage of the language seen in christian writings of the time it was more in line with everyday speech not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses citation needed despite dialectal variation which is found in any widespread language the languages of spain france portugal and italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common christian roman catholic culture it was not until the moorish conquest of spain in 711 cut off communications between the major romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously 14 the vulgar latin dialect that would later become romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties as it was largely cut off from the unifying influences in the western part of the empire one key marker of whether a given romance feature was found in vulgar latin is to compare it with its parallel in classical latin if it was not preferred in classical latin then it most likely came from the undocumented contemporaneous vulgar latin for example the romance for horse italian cavallo french cheval spanish caballo portuguese cavalo and romanian cal came from latin caballus however classical latin used equus therefore caballus was most likely the spoken form 15 vulgar latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest when the earliest extant romance writings begin to appear they were throughout the period confined to everyday speech as medieval latin was used for writing citation needed medieval latin edit main article medieval latin medieval latin is the written latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding latin vernacular existed the spoken language had developed into the various incipient romance languages however in the educated and official world latin continued without its natural spoken base moreover this latin spread into lands that had never spoken latin such as the germanic and slavic nations it became useful for international communication between the member states of the holy roman empire and its allies without the institutions of the roman empire that had supported its uniformity medieval latin lost its linguistic cohesion for example in classical latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive which are compound tenses medieval latin might use fui and fueram instead 16 furthermore the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect latin prevail 16 renaissance latin edit main article renaissance latin the renaissance briefly reinforced the position of latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the renaissance humanists often led by members of the clergy they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature they strove to preserve what they could and restore latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts by no later than the 15th century they had replaced medieval latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities who attempted by scholarship to discover what the classical language had been citation needed new latin edit main article new latin during the early modern age latin still was the most important language of culture in europe therefore until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in latin afterwards most diplomatic documents were written in french and later just native or other languages contemporary latin edit main article contemporary latin the largest organisation that retains latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the catholic church latin remains the language of the roman rite the tridentine mass is celebrated in latin although the mass of paul vi is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language it can be and often is said in latin in part or whole especially at multilingual gatherings it is the official language of the holy see the primary language of its public journal the acta apostolicae sedis and the working language of the roman rota vatican city is also home to the worlds only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in latin 18 in the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of canon law are taught in latin and papers are written in the same language in the anglican church after the publication of the book of common prayer of 1559 a latin edition was published in 1560 for use at universities such as oxford and the leading public schools english private academies where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in latin 19 and there have been several latin translations since most recently a latin edition of the 1979 usa anglican book of common prayer has appeared 20 switzerland has adopted the countrys latin short name helvetia on coins and stamps since there is no room to use all of the nations four official languages for a similar reason it adopted the international vehicle and internet code ch which stands for confoederatio helvetica the countrys full latin name canada s motto a mari usque ad mare from sea to sea and most provincial mottos are also in latin the canadian victoria cross is modelled after the british victoria cross which has the inscription for valour because canada is officially bilingual the canadian medal has replaced the english inscription with the latin pro valore several states of the united states have latin mottos such as connecticut s motto qui transtulit sustinet he who transplanted us sustains us kansas s ad astra per aspera to the stars through hardships michigan s si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice if you seek a pleasant peninsula look about you missouri s salus populi suprema lex esto the health of the people should be the highest law north carolina s esse quam videri to be rather than to seem virginia s sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants and west virginia s montani semper liberi mountaineers are always free many military organizations today have latin mottos such as semper paratus always ready the motto of the united states coast guard semper fidelis always faithful the motto of the united states marine corps and per ardua ad astra through adversitystruggle to the stars the motto of the royal air force raf some colleges and universities have adopted latin mottos for example harvard university s motto is veritas truth veritas was the goddess of truth a daughter of saturn and the mother of virtue latin is taught at many high schools especially in europe and the americas it is most common in british public schools and grammar schools the italian liceo classico and liceo scientifico the german humanistisches gymnasium and the dutch gymnasium in the united states it is taught at baltimore city college boston latin academy boston latin school brooklyn latin school central high school of philadelphia english high school of boston norwell high school massachusetts oak hall school and many other public and private schools some films of ancient settings such as sebastiane and the passion of the christ have been made with dialogue in latin for the sake of realism occasionally latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy in such film television series as the exorcist and lost jughead subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand latin there are also songs written with latin lyrics the libretto for the opera-oratorio oedipus rex by igor stravinsky is in latin occasionally some media outlets targeting enthusiasts broadcast in latin notable examples include radio bremen in germany yle radio in finland and vatican radio television all of which broadcast news segments and other material in latin 21 there are many websites and forums maintained in latin by enthusiasts the latin wikipedia has more than 100000 articles written in latin legacy edit the language has been passed down through various forms inscriptions edit some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed monumental multivolume series the corpus inscriptionum latinarum cil authors and publishers vary but the format is about the same volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information the reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy about 270000 inscriptions are known literature edit the works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in latin have survived in whole or in part in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology they are in part the subject matter of the field of classics their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions such as the loeb classical library published by harvard university press or the oxford classical texts published by oxford university press latin translations of modern literature such as the hobbit treasure island robinson crusoe paddington bear winnie the pooh the adventures of tintin asterix harry potter walter the farting dog le petit prince max and moritz how the grinch stole christmas the cat in the hat and a book of fairy tales fabulae mirabiles are intended to garner popular interest in the language additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into latin such as meissners latin phrasebook influence on present-day languages edit the latin influence in english has been significant at all stages of its insular development in the middle ages borrowing from latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by saint augustine of canterbury in the 6th century or indirectly after the norman conquest through the anglo-norman language from the 16th to the 18th centuries english writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from latin and greek words dubbed inkhorn terms as if they had spilled from a pot of ink many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten but some useful ones survived such as imbibe and extrapolate many of the most common polysyllabic english words are of latin origin through the medium of old french romance words make respectively 59 20 and 14 of english german and dutch vocabularies 22 23 24 those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included the influence of roman governance and roman technology on the less-developed nations under roman dominion led to the adoption of latin phraseology in some specialized areas such as science technology medicine and law for example the linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by historia naturalis an encyclopedia of people places plants animals and things published by pliny the elder roman medicine recorded in the works of such physicians as galen established that todays medical terminology would be primarily derived from latin and greek words the greek being filtered through the latin roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of latin legal terms a few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by latin interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified modern version of the language dubious discuss latino sine flexione popular in the early 20th century is latin with its inflections stripped away among other grammatical changes one study analyzing the degree of differentiation of romance languages in comparison to latin comparing phonology inflection discourse syntax vocabulary and intonation indicated the following percentages the higher the percentage the greater the distance from latin sardinian 8 italian 12 spanish 20 romanian 23.5 occitan 25 portuguese 31 and french 44 25 education edit throughout european history an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles instruction in latin is an essential aspect in todays world a large number of latin students in the us learn from wheelocks latin the classic introductory latin course based on ancient authors this book first published in 1956 26 was written by frederic m wheelock who received a phd from harvard university wheelocks latin has become the standard text for many american introductory latin courses the living latin movement attempts to teach latin in the same way that living languages are taught as a means of both spoken and written communication it is available at the vatican and at some institutions in the us such as the university of kentucky and iowa state university the british cambridge university press is a major supplier of latin textbooks for all levels such as the cambridge latin course series it has also published a subseries of childrens texts in latin by bell forte which recounts the adventures of a mouse called minimus in the united kingdom the classical association encourages the study of antiquity through various means such as publications and grants the university of cambridge 27 the open university 28 a number of prestigious independent schools for example eton harrow haberdashers askes boys school and via facilis 29 a london-based charity run latin courses in the united states and in canada the american classical league supports every effort to further the study of classics its subsidiaries include the national junior classical league with more than 50000 members which encourages high school students to pursue the study of latin and the national senior classical league which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college the league also sponsors the national latin exam classicist mary beard wrote in the times literary supplement in 2006 that the reason for learning latin is because of what was written in it 30 official status edit latin was or is the official language of european states holy see used in the diocese with italian being the official language of vatican city hungary latin was the sole official language of the kingdom of hungary from the 11th century to the mid 19th century when it was replaced by hungarian in 1844 the best known latin language poet originating from hungary was janus pannonius croatia latin was the official language of croatian parliament sabor from the 13th to the 19th century 1847 the oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions congregatio regni totius sclavonie generalis held in zagreb zagabria croatia date from 19 april 1273 an extensive croatian latin literature exists latin is still used on croatian coins on even years 31 poland kingdom of poland officially recognised and widely used 32 33 34 35 between the 10th and 18th centuries commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility 36 phonology edit main article latin spelling and pronunciation the ancient pronunciation of latin has been reconstructed among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors misspellings puns ancient etymologies and the spelling of latin loanwords in other languages 37 consonants edit the consonant phonemes of classical latin are shown in the following table 38 in old and classical latin the latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase and the letters j u w did not exist in place of j u i v were used respectively i v represented both vowels and consonants most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase as can be seen in the inscription from the colosseum shown at the top of the article the spelling systems used in latin dictionaries and modern editions of latin texts however normally use i u in place of classical-era i v some systems use j v for the consonant sounds j w except in the combinations gu su qu for which v is never used some notes concerning the mapping of latin phonemes to english graphemes are given below in classical latin as in modern italian double consonant letters were pronounced as long consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants thus the nn in classical latin annus year and in italian anno is pronounced as a doubled nn as in english unnamed in english distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or morphemes as in that example vowels edit simple vowels edit in classical latin u did not exist as a letter distinct from v the written form v was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant y was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from greek but it was pronounced like u and i by some speakers it was also used in native latin words by confusion with greek words of similar meaning such as sylva and classical latin distinguished between long and short vowels then long vowels except for i were frequently marked using the apex which was sometimes similar to an acute accent v long i was written using a taller version of i called i longa long i in modern texts long vowels are often indicated by a macron and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words when they are marked with a breve long vowels in classical latin were pronounced with a different quality from short vowels and also were longer the difference is described in table below a vowel letter followed by m at the end of a word or a vowel letter followed by n before s or f represented a long nasal vowel as in monstrum mstr diphthongs edit classical latin had several diphthongs the two most common were ae au oe was fairly rare and ui eu ei were very rare at least in native latin words 41 there has also been debate over whether ui is truly a diphthong in classical latin due to its rarity absence in works of roman grammarians and the roots of classical latin words ie hui ce to huic quoi to cui etc not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if ui were to be considered a diphthong 42 the sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs ae and oe also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in anus aens of bronze and copit kept began and au ui eu ei ou represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels j w in cav kawe beware cuius kjjs whose monu mni i warned solv swi i released dlv delewi i destroyed eius jjs his and novus nws new old latin had more diphthongs but most of them changed into long vowels in classical latin the old latin diphthong ai and the sequence became classical ae old latin oi and ou changed to classical except in a few words whose oi became classical oe these two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root for instance classical poena punishment and pnre to punish 41 early old latin ei usually changed to classical 43 in vulgar latin and the romance languages ae au oe merged with e a similar pronunciation also existed during the classical latin period for less-educated speakers 41 orthography edit main article latin alphabet latin was written in the latin alphabet derived from the old italic script which was in turn drawn from the greek alphabet and ultimately the phoenician alphabet 44 this alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the romance celtic germanic baltic finnic and many slavic languages polish slovak slovene croatian and czech and it has been adopted by many languages around the world including vietnamese the austronesian languages many turkic languages and most languages in sub-saharan africa the americas and oceania making it by far the worlds single most widely used writing system the number of letters in the latin alphabet has varied when it was first derived from the etruscan alphabet it contained only 21 letters 45 later g was added to represent which had previously been spelled c and z ceased to be included in the alphabet as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative 46 the letters y and z were later added to represent greek letters upsilon and zeta respectively in greek loanwords 46 w was created in the 11th century from vv it represented w in germanic languages not latin which still uses v for the purpose j was distinguished from the original i only during the late middle ages as was the letter u from v 46 although some latin dictionaries use j it is rarely used for latin text as it was not used in classical times but many other languages use it classical latin did not contain sentence punctuation letter case 47 or interword spacing but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words the first line of catullus 3 originally written as lvgtevenerscvpdinsqve mourn o venuses and cupids or with interpunct as lvgtevenerscvpdinsqve would be rendered in a modern edition as lugete o veneres cupidinesque or with macrons lgte veners cupdinsque or with apices lgte veners cupdinsque the roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts an especially extensive set having been discovered at vindolanda on hadrians wall in britain most notable is the fact that while most of the vindolanda tablets show spaces between words spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era alternate scripts edit occasionally latin has been written in other scripts the praeneste fibula is a 7th-century bc pin with an old latin inscription written using the etruscan script the rear panel of the early 8th-century franks casket has an inscription that switches from old english in anglo-saxon runes to latin in latin script and to latin in runes grammar edit main articles latin grammar and latin syntax latin is a synthetic fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology in more traditional terminology it is an inflected language but typologists are apt to say inflecting words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word the fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements am i love is produced from a semantic element ama love to which a first person singular marker is suffixed the grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers the word is inflected to express different grammatical functions but the semantic element does not change inflection uses affixing and infixing affixing is prefixing and suffixing latin inflections are never prefixed for example ambit he or she or it will love is formed from the same stem am to which a future tense marker bi is suffixed and a third person singular marker t is suffixed there is an inherent ambiguity t may denote more than one grammatical category masculine feminine or neuter gender a major task in understanding latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context all natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another the inflections express gender number and case in adjectives nouns and pronouns a process called declension markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs to denote person number tense voice mood and aspect a process called conjugation some words are uninflected and undergo neither process such as adverbs prepositions and interjections nouns edit main article latin declension a regular latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions a group of nouns with similar inflected forms the declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun the first declension with a predominant ending letter of a is signified by the genitive singular ending of ae the second declension with a predominant ending letter of o is signified by the genitive singular ending of i the third declension with a predominant ending letter of i is signified by the genitive singular ending of is the fourth declension with a predominant ending letter of u is signified by the genitive singular ending of s the fifth declension with a predominant ending letter of e is signified by the genitive singular ending of ei there are seven latin noun cases which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a nouns syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections thus word order is not as important in latin as it is in english which is less inflected the general structure and word order of a latin sentence can therefore vary the cases are as follows nominative used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative the thing or person acting the girl ran puella cucurrit or cucurrit puella genitive used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object the horse of the man or the mans horse in both instances the word man would be in the genitive case when it is translated into latin it also indicates the partitive in which the material is quantified a group of people a number of gifts people and gifts would be in the genitive case some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives the cup is full of wine poculum plnum vn est the master of the slave had beaten him dominus serv eum verberverat dative used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence with special verbs with certain prepositions and if it is used as agent reference or even possessor the merchant hands the stola to the woman merctor fminae stolam trdit accusative used when the noun is the direct object of the subject and as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which the man killed the boy vir necvit puerum ablative used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source cause agent or instrument or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions adverbial you walked with the boy cum puer ambulvist vocative used when the noun is used in a direct address the vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative but exceptions include second-declension nouns ending in us the us becomes an e in the vocative singular if it ends in ius such as flius the ending is just fil as distinct from the nominative plural fili in the vocative singular master shouted the slave domine clmvit servus locative used to indicate a location corresponding to the english in or at it is far less common than the other six cases of latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns such as the word domus house in the singular of the first and second declensions its form coincides with the genitive roma becomes romae in rome in the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions it coincides with the ablative athnae becomes athns at athens in the fourth-declension word domus the locative form dom at home differs from the standard form of all other cases latin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so puer currit can mean either the boy is running or a boy is running adjectives edit main article latin declension there are two types of regular latin adjectives first and second declension and third-declension they are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first and second-declension and third-declension nouns respectively latin adjectives also have comparative more er and superlative most est forms there are also a number of latin participles latin numbers are sometimes declined see numbers below first and second-declension adjectives edit first and second-declension adjectives are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms for example for mortuus mortua mortuum dead mortua is declined like a regular first-declension noun such as puella girl mortuus is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun such as dominus lord master and mortuum is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun such as auxilium help first and second declension er adjectives some first and second declension adjectives have an er as the masculine nominative singular form and are declined like regular first and second-declension adjectives some but not all adjectives keep the e for all of the forms third declension adjectives edit third-declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns with a few exceptions in the plural nominative neuter for example the ending is ia omnia all everything and for third-declension nouns the plural nominative neuter ending is a or ia capita heads animalia animals they can have one two or three forms for the masculine feminine and neuter nominative singular participles edit latin participles like english participles are formed from a verb there are a few main types of participles present active participles perfect passive participles future active participles and future passive participles prepositions edit latin sometimes uses prepositions depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used prepositions can take two cases for their object the accusative apud puerum with the boy with puerum being the accusative form of puer boy and the ablative sine puero without the boy puero being the ablative form of puer boy verbs edit main article latin conjugation a regular verb in latin belongs to one of four main conjugations a conjugation is a class of verbs with similar inflected forms 48 the conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verbs present stem the present stem can be found by omitting the re r in deponent verbs ending from the present infinitive form the infinitive of the first conjugation ends in re or ri active and passive respectively amre to love hortr to exhort of the second conjugation by re or r monre to warn verr to fear of the third conjugation by ere dcere to lead t to use of the fourth by re r audre to hear experr to attempt 49 irregular verbs may not follow the types or may be marked in a different way the endings presented above are not the suffixed infinitive markers the first letter in each case is the last of the stem so the conjugations are also called a-conjugation e-conjugation and i-conjugation the fused infinitive ending is re or r third-conjugation stems end in a consonant the consonant conjugation further there is a subset of the third conjugation the i-stems which behave somewhat like the fourth conjugation as they are both i-stems one short and the other long 49 the stem categories descend from indo-european and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other indo-european languages there are six general tenses in latin present imperfect future perfect pluperfect and future perfect three moods indicative imperative and subjunctive in addition to the infinitive participle gerund gerundive and supine three persons first second and third two numbers singular and plural two voices active and passive and three aspects perfective imperfective and stative verbs are described by four principal parts the first principal part is the first-person singular present tense indicative mood active voice form of the verb if the verb is impersonal the first principal part will be in the third-person singular the second principal part is the present infinitive active the third principal part is the first-person singular perfect indicative active form like the first principal part if the verb is impersonal the third principal part will be in the third-person singular the fourth principal part is the supine form or alternatively the nominative singular perfect passive participle form of the verb the fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders us for masculine a for feminine and m for neuter in the nominative singular the fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive most modern latin dictionaries if they show only one gender tend to show the masculine but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter as it coincides with the supine the fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs but strictly in latin they can be made passive if they are used impersonally and the supine exists for such verbs there are six tenses in the latin language these are divided into two tense systems the present system which is made up of the present imperfect and future tenses and the perfect system which is made up of the perfect pluperfect and future perfect tenses each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to subject nominative pronouns are generally omitted for the first i we and second you persons unless emphasis on the subject is desired the table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses for the future tense the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations the future perfect endings are identical to the future forms of sum with the exception of erint and that the pluperfect endings are identical to the imperfect forms of sum deponent verbs edit some latin verbs are deponent causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning hortor hortr horttus sum to urge vocabulary edit as latin is an italic language most of its vocabulary is likewise italic ultimately from the ancestral proto-indo-european language however because of close cultural interaction the romans not only adapted the etruscan alphabet to form the latin alphabet but also borrowed some etruscan words into their language including persona mask and histrio actor 50 latin also included vocabulary borrowed from oscan another italic language after the fall of tarentum 272 bc the romans began hellenizing or adopting features of greek culture including the borrowing of greek words such as camera vaulted roof sumbolum symbol and balineum bath 50 this hellenization led to the addition of y and z to the alphabet to represent greek sounds 51 subsequently the romans transplanted greek art medicine science and philosophy to italy paying almost any price to entice greek skilled and educated persons to rome and sending their youth to be educated in greece thus many latin scientific and philosophical words were greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with greek words as ars craft and art 52 because of the roman empires expansion and subsequent trade with outlying european tribes the romans borrowed some northern and central european words such as beber beaver of germanic origin and bracae breeches of celtic origin 52 the specific dialects of latin across latin-speaking regions of the former roman empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions the dialects of latin evolved into different romance languages during and after the adoption of christianity into roman society christian vocabulary became a part of the language either from greek or hebrew borrowings or as latin neologisms 53 continuing into the middle ages latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages including old english and other germanic languages over the ages latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives nouns and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments 54 for example the compound adjective omnipotens all-powerful was produced from the adjectives omnis all and potens powerful by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating often the concatenation changed the part of speech and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives 55 phrases edit the phrases are mentioned with accents to show where stress is placed 56 in latin most words are stressed at the second-last penultimate syllable called in latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima 57 a few words are stressed at the third-last syllable called in latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima 57 slve to one person salvte to more than one person hello ve to
