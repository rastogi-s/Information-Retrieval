constantinople wikipedia constantinople this article is about the historical city from 330 to 1453 for its predecessor in greek and early roman times see byzantium for constantinople during the ottoman era and the modern city see istanbul for other uses see constantinople disambiguation constantinople greek konstantinopolis latin constantinopolis was the capital city of the roman byzantine 3301204 and 12611453 and also of the brief latin 12041261 and the later ottoman 14531923 empires it was reinaugurated in 324 ad from ancient byzantium as the new capital of the roman empire by emperor constantine the great after whom it was named and dedicated on 11 may 330 ad 5 from the mid-5th century to the early 13th century constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in europe 6 and it was instrumental in the advancement of christianity during roman and byzantine times as the home of the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople and as the guardian of christendoms holiest relics such as the crown of thorns and the true cross after the final loss of its provinces in the early 15th century the byzantine empire was reduced to just constantinople and its environs along with morea in greece and the city eventually fell to the ottomans after a 53-day siege on 29 may 1453 constantinople was famed for its massive and complex defences although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples the defences of constantinople proved invulnerable for nearly nine hundred years before the city was taken in 1204 by the crusader armies of the fourth crusade and after it was liberated in 1261 by the byzantine emperor michael viii palaiologos a second and final time in 1453 when it was conquered by the ottoman sultan mehmed ii the first wall of the city was erected by constantine i and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts later in the 5th century the praetorian prefect anthemius under the child emperor theodosius ii undertook the construction of the theodosian walls which consisted of a double wall lying about 2km 1.2 miles to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front 7 this formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of antiquity the city was built intentionally to rival rome and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched the seven hills of rome because it was located between the golden horn and the sea of marmara the land area that needed defensive walls was reduced and this helped it to present an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces domes and towers the result of the prosperity that was engendered by its being the gateway between two continents europe and asia and two seas the mediterranean and the black sea the city was also famed for its architectural masterpieces such as the greek orthodox cathedral of hagia sophia which served as the seat of the ecumenical patriarchate the sacred imperial palace where the emperors lived the galata tower the hippodrome the golden gate of the land walls and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares the university of constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453 8 including its vast imperial library which contained the remnants of the library of alexandria and had over 100000 volumes of ancient texts 9 constantinople never truly recovered from the devastation of the fourth crusade and the decades of misrule by the latins although the city partially recovered in the early years after the restoration under the palaiologos dynasty the advent of the ottomans and the subsequent loss of the imperial territories until it became an enclave inside the fledgling ottoman empire rendered the city severely depopulated when it fell to the ottoman turks 10 whereafter it replaced edirne adrianople as the new capital of the ottoman empire 11 names edit before constantinople edit according to pliny the elder in his natural history the first known name of a settlement on the site of constantinople was lygos 12 a settlement of likely thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th century bc 13 the site according to the founding myth of the city was abandoned by the time greek settlers from the city-state of megara founded byzantium greek byzntion in around 657 bc 14 across from the town of chalcedon on the asiatic side of the bosphorus the origins of the name of byzantion more commonly known by the later latin byzantium are not entirely clear though some suggest it is of thraco illyrian origin 15 16 the founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement was named after the leader of the megarian colonists byzas the later byzantines of constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named in honour of two men byzas and antes though this was more likely just a play on the word byzantion 17 the city was briefly renamed augusta antonina in the early 3rd century by the emperor septimius severus 193211 having razed the city to the ground in 196 ad for supporting a rival contender in the civil war and rebuilt in honour of his son antoninus the later emperor caracalla 18 19 the name appears to have been quickly forgotten and abandoned and the city reverted to byzantiumbyzantion after either the assassination of caracalla in 217 or at the latest the fall of the severan dynasty in 235 names of constantinople edit main article names of constantinople byzantium took on the name of konstantinoupolis city of constantine constantinople after its re-foundation under roman emperor constantine i who transferred the capital of the roman empire from rome to byzantium in 330 ad and designated his new capital officially as nova roma new rome during this time the city was also called second rome eastern rome and roma constantinopolitana 20 as the city became the sole remaining capital of the roman empire after the fall of the west and its wealth population and influence grew the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames as the largest and wealthiest city in europe during the 4th13th centuries and a centre of culture and education of the mediterranean basin constantinople came to be known by prestigious titles such as basileuousa queen of cities and megalopolis the great city and was in colloquial speech commonly referred to as just polis the city by constantinopolitans and provincial byzantines alike 21 in the language of other peoples constantinople was referred to just as reverently the medieval vikings who had contacts with the empire through their expansion in eastern europe varangians used the old norse name miklagarr from mikill big and garr city and later miklagard and miklagarth in arabic the city was sometimes called rmiyyat al-kubra great city of the romans and in persian as takht-e rum throne of the romans in east and south slavic languages including in medieval russia constantinople was referred to as tsargrad or carigrad city of the caesar emperor from the slavonic words tsar caesar or king and grad city this was presumably a calque on a greek phrase such as vasileos polis the city of the emperor king modern names of the city edit the modern turkish name for the city stanbul derives from the greek phrase eis tin polin meaning into the city or to the city 22 this name was used in turkish alongside kostantiniyye the more formal adaptation of the original constantinople during the period of ottoman rule while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as constantinople until the early 20th century in 1928 the turkish alphabet was changed from arabic script to latin script after that as part of the 1920s turkification movement turkey started to urge other countries to use turkish names for turkish cities instead of other transliterations to latin script that had been used in the ottoman times 23 24 25 26 in time the city came to be known as istanbul and its variations in most world languages the name constantinople is still used by members of the eastern orthodox church in the title of one of their most important leaders the orthodox patriarch based in the city referred to as his most divine all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch in greece today the city is still called konstantinopoliskonstantinopoli or simply just the city history edit byzantium and earlier settlements edit main article byzantium constantinople was founded by the roman emperor constantine i 272337 ad in 324 5 on the site of an already-existing city byzantium which was settled in the early days of greek colonial expansion in around 657 bc by colonists of the city-state of megara this is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later constantinople but the first known settlements was that of lygos referred to in plinys natural histories 27 apart from this little is known about this initial settlement the site according to the founding myth of the city was abandoned by the time greek settlers from the city-state of megara founded byzantium greek byzntion in around 657 bc14 across from the town of chalcedon on the asiatic side of the bosphorus the city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by darius i in 512 bc into the persian empire who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a pontoon bridge crossing into europe as byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the bosphorus strait persian rule lasted until 478 bc when as part of the greek counterattack to the second persian invasion of greece a greek army led by the spartan general pausanias captured the city which remained an independent yet subordinate city under the athenians and later to the spartans after 411 bc 28 a farsighted treaty with the emergent power of rome in c150 bc which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter roman rule unscathed 29 this treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as byzantium would maintain this independent status and prosper under peace and stability in the pax romana for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century ad 30 byzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of athens corinth and sparta but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position the site lay astride the land route from europe to asia and the seaway from the black sea to the mediterranean and had in the golden horn an excellent and spacious harbour already then in greek and early roman times byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture and its position at the crossroads of the asiatic-european trade route over land and as the gateway between the mediterranean and black seas made it too valuable a settlement to abandon as emperor septimius severus later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting pescennius niger s claimancy 31 it was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian cassius dio who said that severus had destroyed a strong roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from pontus and asia 32 he would later rebuild byzantium towards the end of his reign in which it would be briefly renamed augusta antonina fortifying it with a new city wall in his name the severan wall 324337 foundation of constantinople edit constantine had altogether more colourful plans having restored the unity of the empire and being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the christian church he was well aware that rome was an unsatisfactory capital rome was too far from the frontiers and hence from the armies and the imperial courts and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location nevertheless constantine identified the site of byzantium as the right place a place where an emperor could sit readily defended with easy access to the danube or the euphrates frontiers his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of roman asia his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the empire constantinople was built over 6 years and consecrated on 11 may 330 5 33 constantine divided the expanded city like rome into 14 regions and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis 34 yet at first constantines new rome did not have all the dignities of old rome it possessed a proconsul rather than an urban prefect it had no praetors tribunes or quaestors although it did have senators they held the title clarus not clarissimus like those of rome it also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply police statues temples sewers aqueducts or other public works the new programme of building was carried out in great haste columns marbles doors and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city in similar fashion many of the greatest works of greek and roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets the emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in asiana and pontica and on 18 may 332 he announced that as in rome free distributions of food would be made to the citizens at the time the amount is said to have been 80000 rations a day doled out from 117 distribution points around the city 35 constantine laid out a new square at the centre of old byzantium naming it the augustaeum the new senate-house or curia was housed in a basilica on the east side on the south side of the great square was erected the great palace of the emperor with its imposing entrance the chalke and its ceremonial suite known as the palace of daphne nearby was the vast hippodrome for chariot-races seating over 80000 spectators and the famed baths of zeuxippus at the western entrance to the augustaeum was the milion a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the eastern roman empire from the augustaeum led a great street the mese greek lit middle street lined with colonnades as it descended the first hill of the city and climbed the second hill it passed on the left the praetorium or law-court then it passed through the oval forum of constantine where there was a second senate-house and a high column with a statue of constantine himself in the guise of helios crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun from there the mese passed on and through the forum tauri and then the forum bovis and finally up the seventh hill or xerolophus and through to the golden gate in the constantinian wall after the construction of the theodosian walls in the early 5th century it was extended to the new golden gate reaching a total length of seven roman miles 36 337529 constantinople during the barbarian invasions and the fall of the west edit the importance of constantinople increased but it was gradual from the death of constantine in 337 to the accession of theodosius i emperors had been resident only in the years 337-8 34751 35861 36869 its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known urban prefect of the city honoratus who held office from 11 december 359 until 361 the urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of thrace in which the city was located pontus and asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of rome the emperor valens who hated the city and spent only one year there nevertheless built the palace of hebdomon on the shore of the propontis near the golden gate probably for use when reviewing troops all the emperors up to zeno and basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the hebdomon theodosius i founded the church of john the baptist to house the skull of the saint today preserved at the topkap palace put up a memorial pillar to himself in the forum of taurus and turned the ruined temple of aphrodite into a coach house for the praetorian prefect arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the mese near the walls of constantine after the shock of the battle of adrianople in 378 in which the emperor valens with the flower of the roman armies was destroyed by the visigoths within a few days march the city looked to its defences and in 413414 theodosius ii built the 18-metre 60-foot-tall triple-wall fortifications which were not to be breached until the coming of gunpowder theodosius also founded a university near the forum of taurus on 27 february 425 uldin a prince of the huns appeared on the danube about this time and advanced into thrace but he was deserted by many of his followers who joined with the romans in driving their king back north of the river subsequent to this new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the danube improved after the barbarians overran the western roman empire constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the roman empire emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces they remained in their palace in the great city and sent generals to command their armies the wealth of the eastern mediterranean and western asia flowed into constantinople 527565 constantinople in the age of justinian edit the emperor justinian i 527565 was known for his successes in war for his legal reforms and for his public works it was from constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former diocese of africa set sail on or about 21 june 533 before their departure the ship of the commander belisarius was anchored in front of the imperial palace and the patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise after the victory in 534 the temple treasure of jerusalem looted by the romans in 70 ad and taken to carthage by the vandals after their sack of rome in 455 was brought to constantinople and deposited for a time perhaps in the church of st polyeuctus before being returned to jerusalem in either the church of the resurrection or the new church 38 chariot-racing had been important in rome for centuries in constantinople the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance it was where as a shadow of the popular elections of old rome the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor and also where they openly criticized the government or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers in the time of justinian public order in constantinople became a critical political issue throughout the late roman and early byzantine periods christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity and the dispute between the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the blues and the greens the partisans of the blues and the greens were said 39 to affect untrimmed facial hair head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence at last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532 known as the nika riots from the battle-cry of victory of those involved fires started by the nika rioters consumed constantines basilica of hagia sophia holy wisdom the citys principal church which lay to the north of the augustaeum justinian commissioned anthemius of tralles and isidore of miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable hagia sophia this was the great cathedral of the orthodox church whose dome was said to be held aloft by god alone and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets 40 the dedication took place on 26 december 537 in the presence of the emperor who exclaimed o solomon i have outdone thee 41 hagia sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests and cost 20000 pounds of gold to build 42 justinian also had anthemius and isidore demolish and replace the original church of the holy apostles built by constantine with a new church under the same dedication this was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes and ornamented with beautiful mosaics this church was to remain the burial place of the emperors from constantine himself until the 11th century when the city fell to the turks in 1453 the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of mehmet ii the conqueror justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the citys built environment legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within 100 feet 30m of the sea front in order to protect the view 43 during justinian is reign the citys population reached about 500000 people 44 however the social fabric of constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the plague of justinian between 541542 ad it killed perhaps 40 of the citys inhabitants 45 survival 565717 constantinople during the byzantine dark ages edit in the early 7th century the avars and later the bulgars overwhelmed much of the balkans threatening constantinople with attack from the west simultaneously the persian sassanids overwhelmed the prefecture of the east and penetrated deep into anatolia heraclius son of the exarch of africa set sail for the city and assumed the purple he found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to carthage but relented after the people of constantinople begged him to stay the citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when heraclius realised that the city could no longer be supplied from egypt as a result of the persian wars the population fell substantially as a result 46 while the city withstood a siege by the sassanids and avars in 626 heraclius campaigned deep into persian territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628 when the persians surrendered all their conquests however further sieges followed the arab conquests first from 674 to 678 and then in 717 to 718 the theodosian walls kept the city impregnable from the land while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as greek fire allowed the byzantine navy to destroy the arab fleets and keep the city supplied in the second siege the second ruler of bulgaria khan tervel rendered decisive help he was called saviour of europe 47 7171025 constantinople during the macedonian renaissance edit in the 730s leo iii carried out extensive repairs of the theodosian walls which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the empire 48 theodora widow of the emperor theophilus died 842 acted as regent during the minority of her son michael iii who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother bardas when michael assumed power in 856 he became known for excessive drunkenness appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy he removed theodora from the great palace to the carian palace and later to the monastery of gastria but after the death of bardas she was released to live in the palace of st mamas she also had a rural residence at the anthemian palace where michael was assassinated in 867 49 in 860 an attack was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at kiev by askold and dir two varangian chiefs two hundred small vessels passed through the bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban princes islands oryphas the admiral of the byzantine fleet alerted the emperor michael who promptly put the invaders to flight but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens 50 in 980 the emperor basil ii received an unusual gift from prince vladimir of kiev 6000 varangian warriors which basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the varangian guard they were known for their ferocity honour and loyalty it is said that in 1038 they were dispersed in winter quarters in the thracesian theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him instead of taking revenge however his comrades applauded her conduct compensated her with all his possessions and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide 51 however following the death of an emperor they became known also for plunder in the imperial palaces 52 later in the 11th century the varangian guard became dominated by anglo-saxons who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new norman kings of england 53 the book of the eparch which dates to the 10th century gives a detailed picture of the citys commercial life and its organization at that time the corporations in which the tradesmen of constantinople were organised were supervised by the eparch who regulated such matters as production prices import and export each guild had its own monopoly and tradesmen might not belong to more than one it is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office then known by the latin version of its title had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of rome 54 in the 9th and 10th centuries constantinople had a population of between 500000 and 800000 55 iconoclast controversy in constantinople edit in the 8th and 9th centuries the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the empire the emperor leo iii issued a decree in 726 against images and ordered the destruction of a statue of christ over one of the doors of the chalke an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens 56 constantine v convoked a church council in 754 which condemned the worship of images after which many treasures were broken burned or painted over with depictions of trees birds or animals one source refers to the church of the holy virgin at blachernae as having been transformed into a fruit store and aviary 57 following the death of her son leo iv in 780 the empress irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the second council of nicaea in 787 the iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of empress theodora who restored the icons these controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the western and the eastern churches 10251081 constantinople after basil ii edit in the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the battle of manzikert in armenia in 1071 the emperor romanus diogenes was captured the peace terms demanded by alp arslan sultan of the seljuk turks were not excessive and romanus accepted them on his release however romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture and the new ruler michael vii ducas refused to honour the treaty in response the turks began to move into anatolia in 1073 the collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition and the empires resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars thousands of turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into anatolia by 1080 a huge area had been lost to the empire and the turks were within striking distance of constantinople 10811185 constantinople under the comneni edit under the comnenian dynasty 10811185 byzantium staged a remarkable recovery in 109091 the nomadic pechenegs reached the walls of constantinople where emperor alexius i with the aid of the kipchaks annihilated their army 58 in response to a call for aid from alexius the first crusade assembled at constantinople in 1096 but declining to put itself under byzantine command set out for jerusalem on its own account 59 john ii built the monastery of the pantocrator almighty with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds 60 with the restoration of firm central government the empire became fabulously wealthy the population was rising estimates for constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100000 to 500000 and towns and cities across the realm flourished meanwhile the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased this was reflected in constantinople by the construction of the blachernae palace the creation of brilliant new works of art and general prosperity at this time an increase in trade made possible by the growth of the italian city-states may have helped the growth of the economy it is certain that the venetians and others were active traders in constantinople making a living out of shipping goods between the crusader kingdoms of outremer and the west while also trading extensively with byzantium and egypt the venetians had factories on the north side of the golden horn and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century toward the end of manuel i komnenos s reign the number of foreigners in the city reached about 6000080000 people out of a total population of about 400000 people 61 in 1171 constantinople also contained a small community of 2500 jews 62 in 1182 all latin western european inhabitants of constantinople were massacred 63 in artistic terms the 12th century was a very productive period there was a revival in the mosaic art for example mosaics became more realistic and vivid with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms there was an increased demand for art with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work according to nh baynes byzantium an introduction to east roman civilization with its love of luxury and passion for colour the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of byzantium throughout the whole of the christian world beautiful silks from the workshops of constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals lions elephants eagles and griffins confronting each other or represented emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase from the tenth to the twelfth century byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the west by their style arrangement and iconography the mosaics of st marks at venice and of the cathedral at torcello clearly reveal their byzantine origin similarly those of the palatine chapel the martorana at palermo and the cathedral of cefal together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at monreale demonstrate the influence of byzantium on the norman court of sicily in the twelfth century hispano moorish art was unquestionably derived from the byzantine romanesque art owes much to the east from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings as is proved for instance by the domed churches of south-western france princes of kiev venetian doges abbots of monte cassino merchants of amalfi and the kings of sicily all looked to byzantium for artists or works of art such was the influence of byzantine art in the twelfth century that russia venice southern italy and sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production 11851261 constantinople during the imperial exile edit on 25 july 1197 constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the latin quarter and the area around the gate of the droungarios turkish odun kaps on the golden horn 64 65 nevertheless the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the crusaders in the course of a plot between philip of swabia boniface of montferrat and the doge of venice the fourth crusade was despite papal excommunication diverted in 1203 against constantinople ostensibly promoting the claims of alexius son of the deposed emperor isaac the reigning emperor alexius iii had made no preparation the crusaders occupied galata broke the defensive chain protecting the golden horn and entered the harbour where on 27 july they breached the sea walls alexius iii fled but the new alexius iv found the treasury inadequate and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies tension between the citizens and the latin soldiers increased in january 1204 the protovestiarius alexius murzuphlus provoked a riot it is presumed to intimidate alexius iv but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of athena the work of phidias which stood in the principal forum facing west in february the people rose again alexius iv was imprisoned and executed and murzuphlus took the purple as alexius v he made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution an attack by the crusaders on 6 april failed but a second from the golden horn on 12 april succeeded and the invaders poured in alexius v fled the senate met in hagia sophia and offered the crown to theodore lascaris who had married into the angelid family but it was too late he came out with the patriarch to the golden milestone before the great palace and addressed the varangian guard then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for asia by the next day the doge and the leading franks were installed in the great palace and the city was given over to pillage for three days sir steven runciman historian of the crusades wrote that the sack of constantinople is unparalleled in history for nine centuries he goes on the great city had been the capital of christian civilisation it was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen the venetians seized treasures and carried them off to adorn their town but the frenchmen and flemings were filled with a lust for destruction they rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry pausing only to murder or to rape or to break open the wine-cellars neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared in hagia sophia itself drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver iconostasis to pieces while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot while they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the patriarchs throne and began to sing a ribald french song nuns were ravished in their convents palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked wounded women and children lay dying in the streets for three days the ghastly scenes continued till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles when order was restored citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide 66 for the next half-century constantinople was the seat of the latin empire under the rulers of the latin empire the city declined both in population and the condition of its buildings alice-mary talbot cites an estimated population for constantinople of 400000 inhabitants after the destruction wrought by the crusaders on the city about one third were homeless and numerous courtiers nobility and higher clergy followed various leading personages into exile as a result constantinople became seriously depopulated talbot concludes 67 the latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries most prominently the hagia sophia which became the cathedral of the latin patriarch of constantinople it is to these that eh swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors 68 however this act of maintenance is an exception for the most part the latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings either secular and sacred and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded empire for defense and to support the court deno john geanokoplos writes that it may well be that a division is suggested here latin laymen stripped secular buildings ecclesiastics the churches 69 buildings were not the only targets
