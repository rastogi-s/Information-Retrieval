highly charged ion wikipedia highly charged ion highly charged ions hci are ions in very high charge states due to the loss of many or most of their bound electrons by energetic collisions or high-energy photon absorption examples are 13-fold ionized iron fe 13 or fe xiv in spectroscopic notation found in the suns corona or naked uranium u 92 bare all bound electrons which requires very high energy for its production hci are found in stellar coronae in active galactic nuclei in supernova remnants and in accretion disks most of the visible matter found in the universe consists of highly charged ions citation needed 1 high temperature plasmas used for nuclear fusion energy research also contain hci generated by the plasma-wall interaction see tokamak in the laboratory hci are investigated by means of heavy ion particle accelerators and electron beam ion traps 2
