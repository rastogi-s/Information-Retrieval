assyrian eclipse wikipedia assyrian eclipse the assyrian eclipse also known as bur-sagale bur-saggile pur-sagale or par-sagale eclipse was a solar eclipse that occurred on 15 june 763 bc proleptic julian calendar it was recorded in assyrian eponym lists most likely in the ninth year of the reign of king ashur-dan iii the entry is short and reads bur-sagale of guzana revolt in the city of assur in the month simanu an eclipse of the sun took place the phrase used shamash the sun akallu bent twisted crooked distorted obscured has been interpreted since the mid-nineteenth century as a reference to a solar eclipse in 1867 henry rawlinson decided that the most likely match was the nearly total eclipse of 15 june 763 bc 1 and this date has been widely accepted ever since historians consider this record a crucial point of reference for providing exact dates of assyrian chronology before the seventh century bc however the original record is lacking details of the observation it may have been observed anywhere in assyria not necessarily in assur or nineveh babylonian calendar edit see also babylonian calendar apparently there has been some controversy on whether the eclipse of 24 june 791 bc is not a better candidate than 15 june 763 bc for the possible eclipse mentioned in the record see graph citation needed this depends on when the assyrians started their luni-solar year the mainstream view is that the beginning of the babylonian year was not determined by observing the equinox but by observing the appearance of certain constellations 2 a detailed examination of 101 new year dates between 748 and 539 bc shows that the dates of the new year shifted citation needed in the eighth century it often began before the vernal equinox the commonly-held belief is that the aimed-for beginning of the babylonian year in the eighth century fell about two weeks before the equinox during the reign of nabopolassar 625-605 bc there was a shift to about ten days after the equinox although there still were years when the new year began before the equinox in summary the situation in babylonia before the last third of the eighth century seems to agree with the statement in mulapin hunger and pingree 1989 that the vernal equinox fell on nisan 15 probably around 730 the aimed-for beginning of the babylonian year was shifted some two weeks upwards in relation to the solar year so the average new years day fell shortly before the vernal equinox this holds true for the entire seventh century only around 600 did a second shift occur which pushed the average beginning of the year to about two weeks after the vernal equinox figure 4b 3 that the eponym canon solar eclipse is identified correctly with the total solar eclipse that occurred in 763 bc is confirmed by other astronomical observations from the same period 4
