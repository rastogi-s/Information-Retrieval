apollo 12 wikipedia apollo 12 apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the united states apollo program and the second to land on the moon it was launched on november 14 1969 from the kennedy space center florida four months after apollo 11 mission commander charles pete conrad and lunar module pilot alan l bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while command module pilot richard f gordon remained in lunar orbit the landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the ocean of storms unlike the first landing on apollo 11 conrad and bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location the site of the surveyor 3 unmanned probe which had landed on april 20 1967 they carried the first color television camera to the lunar surface on an apollo flight but transmission was lost after bean accidentally destroyed the camera by pointing it at the sun on one of two moonwalks they visited the surveyor and removed some parts for return to earth the mission ended on november 24 with a successful splashdown crew edit backup crew edit support crew edit gerald p carr edward g gibson paul j weitz flight directors edit gerry

edit duration 3 hours 49 minutes 15 seconds mission highlights edit launch and transfer edit apollo 12 launched on schedule from kennedy space center during a rainstorm it was the first rocket launch attended by an incumbent us president richard nixon thirty-six-and-a-half seconds after lift-off the vehicle triggered a lightning discharge through itself and down to the earth through the saturns ionized plume protective circuits on the fuel cells in the service module sm falsely detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline along with much of the commandservice module csm instrumentation a second strike at 52 seconds after launch knocked out the 8-ball attitude indicator the telemetry stream at mission control was garbled however the vehicle continued to fly correctly the strikes had not affected the saturn v instrument unit the loss of all three fuel cells put the csm entirely on batteries which were unable to maintain normal 75-ampere launch loads on the 28-volt dc bus one of the ac inverters dropped offline these power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction electrical environmental and consumables manager eecom john aaron remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power supply malfunctioned in the csm signal conditioning electronics sce which converted raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders 4 aaron made a call try sce to aux which switched the sce to a backup power supply the switch was fairly obscure and neither flight director gerald griffin capcom gerald carr nor mission commander pete conrad immediately recognized it lunar module pilot alan bean flying in the right seat as the spacecraft systems engineer remembered the sce switch from a training incident a year earlier when the same failure had been simulated aarons quick thinking and beans memory saved what could have been an aborted mission and earned aaron the reputation of a steely-eyed missile man 5 bean put the fuel cells back on line and with telemetry restored the launch continued successfully once in earth parking orbit the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the s-ivb third stage for trans-lunar injection the lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage initially it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the command module s cm parachute mechanism to prematurely fire disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them citation needed if they were indeed disabled the command module would have crashed uncontrollably into the pacific ocean and killed the crew instantly since there was no way to figure out whether or not this was the case ground controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility the parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission after lunar module lm separation the s-ivb was intended to fly into solar orbit the s-ivb auxiliary propulsion system was fired and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the moons trailing edge the apollo spacecraft always approached the moons leading edge the moons gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit however a small error in the state vector in the saturns guidance system caused the s-ivb to fly past the moon at too high an altitude to achieve earth escape velocity it remained in a semi-stable earth orbit after passing the moon on november 18 1969 it finally escaped earth orbit in 1971 but was briefly recaptured in earth orbit 31 years later it was discovered by amateur astronomer bill yeung who gave it the temporary designation j002e3 before it was determined to be an artificial object 6 7 moon landing edit the apollo 12 mission landed on november 19 1969 on an area of the ocean of storms latin oceanus procellarum that had been visited earlier by several unmanned missions luna 5 surveyor 3 and ranger 7 the international astronomical union recognizing this christened this region mare cognitum known sea the lunar coordinates of the landing site were 301239 s latitude 2342157 w longitude 8 the landing site would thereafter be listed as statio cognitum on lunar maps conrad and bean did not formally name their landing site though conrad nicknamed the intended touchdown area petes parking lot the second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting which would be needed for future apollo missions most of the descent was automatic with manual control assumed by conrad during the final few hundred feet of descent unlike apollo 11 where neil armstrong had to use the manual control to direct his lander downrange of the computers target which was strewn with boulders apollo 12 succeeded in landing at its intended target within walking distance of the surveyor 3 probe which had landed on the moon in april 1967 9 this was the first and to date only occasion in which humans have caught up to a probe sent to land on another world conrad actually landed intrepid 580 feet 177m short of petes parking lot because it looked rougher during final approach than anticipated and was a little under 1180 feet 360m from surveyor 3 a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust being kicked up by intrepids descent engine during landing from covering surveyor 3 10 but the actual touchdown pointapproximately 600 feet 183m from surveyor 3 did cause high velocity sandblasting of the probe it was later determined that the sandblasting removed more dust than it delivered onto the surveyor because the probe was covered by a thin layer that gave it a tan hue as observed by the astronauts and every portion of the surface exposed to the direct sandblasting was lightened back toward the original white color through the removal of lunar dust 11 evas edit when conrad who was somewhat shorter than neil armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface his first words were whoopie man that may have been a small one for neil but thats a long one for me 9 12 this was not an off-the-cuff remark conrad had made a us500 bet with reporter oriana fallaci he would say these words after she had queried whether nasa had instructed neil armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the moon conrad later said he was never able to collect the money 13 14 to improve the quality of television pictures from the moon a color camera was carried on apollo 12 unlike the monochrome camera that was used on apollo 11 unfortunately when bean carried the camera to the place near the lunar module where it was to be set up he inadvertently pointed it directly into the sun destroying the secondary electron conduction sec tube television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately 15 see also apollo tv camera apollo 12 successfully landed within walking distance of the surveyor 3 probe conrad and bean removed pieces of the probe to be taken back to earth for analysis it is claimed that the common bacterium streptococcus mitis was found to have accidentally contaminated the spacecrafts camera prior to launch and survived dormant in this harsh environment for two and a half years 16 however this finding has since been disputed see reports of streptococcus mitis on the moon astronauts conrad and bean also collected rocks and set up equipment that took measurements of the moons seismicity solar wind flux and magnetic field and relayed the measurements to earth the instruments were part of the first complete nuclear-powered alsep station set up by astronauts on the moon to relay long-term data from the lunar surface the instruments on apollo 11 were not as extensive or designed to operate long term the astronauts also took photographs although by accident bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface meanwhile gordon on board the yankee clipper in lunar orbit took multi-spectral photographs of the surface the lunar plaque attached to the descent stage of intrepid is unique in that unlike the other plaques it a did not have a depiction of the earth and b it was textured differently the other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat return edit intrepids ascent stage was dropped per normal procedures after conrad and bean rejoined gordon in orbit it impacted the moon on november 20 1969 at 356s 2112w 394s 2120w 3.94 21.20 apollo 12 intrepid module impact the seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour the crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs for a total lunar surface stay of 31 and a half hours and a total time in lunar orbit of eighty-nine hours on the return flight to earth after leaving lunar orbit the crew of apollo 12 witnessed and photographed a solar eclipse though this one was of the earth eclipsing the sun splashdown edit yankee clipper returned to earth on november 24 1969 at 2058 utc 358pm est 1058am hst in the pacific ocean approximately 500 nautical miles 800km east of american samoa during splashdown a 16 mm film camera dislodged from storage and struck bean in the forehead rendering him briefly unconscious he suffered a mild concussion and needed six stitches 17 after recovery by uss hornet they were flown to pago pago international airport in tafuna for a reception before being flown on a c-141 cargo plane to honolulu stunts and mementos edit alan bean smuggled a camera-shutter self-timer device on to the mission with the intent of taking a photograph with himself pete conrad and the surveyor 3 probe in the frame as the timer was not part of their standard equipment such an image would have thrown post-mission photo analysts into confusion over how the photo was taken however the self-timer was misplaced during the extra-vehicular activity eva and the plan was never executed as one of the many pranks pulled during the friendly rivalry between the all-navy prime crew and the all-air force backup crew the apollo 12 backup crew managed to insert into the astronauts lunar checklist attached to the wrists of conrads and beans space suits reduced-sized pictures of playboy playmates surprising conrad and bean when they looked through the checklist flip-book during their first eva the apollo lunar surface journal website contains a pdf file with the photocopies of their cuff checklists showing these photos 18 appearing in conrads checklist were angela dorian miss september 1967 with the caption seen any interesting hills valleys and reagan wilson miss october 1967 preferred tether partner referring to a special procedure that would require the sharing of life support resources the photos in beans cuff checklist were of cynthia myers miss december 1968 dont forget describe the protuberances and leslie bianchini miss january 1969 survey her activity in pun of surveyor 19 20 the backup crew who did this later flew to the moon themselves on apollo 15 at the back of conrads checklist they had also prepared two pages of complex geological terminology added as a joke to give him the option to sound to mission control like he was as skilled as a professional career geologist the third crewmember orbiting the moon was not left out of the playboy prank as a november 1969 calendar featuring dede lind miss august 1967 had been stowed in a locker that dick gordon found while his crewmates were on the lunar surface in 2011 he put this calendar up for auction its value was estimated by rr auction at us1200015000 21 22 while the command module pilot calendar was in full color the lunar checklists carried black white photocopies although these were dramatized in from the earth to the moon as full color photos in the checklists artist forrest frosty myers claims to have installed the art piece moon museum on a leg of the intrepid landing module with the help of an unnamed engineer at the grumman corporation after attempts to move the project forward through nasas official channels were unsuccessful 23 alan bean left a memento on the moon his silver astronaut pin 9 this pin signified an astronaut who completed training but had not yet flown in space he had worn it for six years he was to get a gold astronaut pin for successfully completing the mission after the flight and felt he wouldnt need the silver pin thereafter 9 tossing his pin into a lunar crater extended the common tradition among military pilots to ceremonially dispose of their originally awarded flight wings mission insignia edit the apollo 12 mission patch shows the crews navy background all three astronauts at the time of the mission were us navy commanders it features a clipper ship arriving at the moon representing the command module yankee clipper the ship trails fire and flies the flag of the united states the mission name apollo xii and the crew names are on a wide gold border with a small blue trim blue and gold are traditional us navy colors the patch has four stars on it one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for clifton williams a us marine corps aviator and astronaut who was killed on october 5 1967 after a mechanical failure caused the controls of his t-38 trainer to stop responding resulting in a crash he trained with conrad and gordon as part of the backup crew for what would be the apollo 9 mission and would have been assigned as lunar module pilot for apollo 12 9 spacecraft location edit the apollo 12 command module yankee clipper is on display at the virginia air and space center in hampton virginia in 2002 astronomers thought they might have discovered another moon orbiting earth which they designated j002e3 that turned out to be the s-ivb third stage of the apollo 12 saturn v rocket 24 the lunar module intrepid impacted the moon november 20 1969 at 2217177 ut 517 pm est 356s 2112w 394s 2120w 3.94 21.20 apollo 12
