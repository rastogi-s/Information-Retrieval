photosphere wikipedia photosphere this article is about the astronomical object for the image stitching feature see vr photography for the solar disk in egyptian mythology see aten not to be confused with photon sphere the photosphere is a stars outer shell from which light is radiated the term itself is derived from ancient greek roots phos photos meaning light and sphaira meaning sphere in reference to it being a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light it extends into a stars surface until the plasma becomes opaque equivalent to an optical depth of approximately 23 1 in other words a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object usually a star that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths temperature edit the surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the stefanboltzmann law stars except neutron stars have no solid surface 2 therefore the photosphere is typically used to describe the sun s or another star s visual surface composition edit the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium they account for 74.9 and 23.8 of the mass of the sun in the photosphere respectively all heavier elements called metals in astronomy account for less than 2 of the mass with oxygen roughly 1 of the suns mass carbon 0.3 neon 0.2 and iron 0.2 being the most abundant sun edit the sun s photosphere has a temperature between 4500 and 6000 k 4230 and 5730c 3 with an effective temperature of 5777 k 5504c 4 and a density of about 1 10 12 kg m 3 5 other stars may have hotter or cooler photospheres the suns photosphere is composed of convection cells called granules cells of plasma each approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter 6 with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the narrow spaces between them each granule has a lifespan of only about eight minutes resulting in a continually shifting boiling pattern grouping the typical granules are super granules up to 30000 kilometers in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours these details are too fine to see on other stars other layers edit the suns visible atmosphere has other layers above the photosphere the 2000 kilometer-deep chromosphere typically observed by filtered light for example h-alpha lies just between the photosphere and the much hotter but more tenuous corona other surface features on the photosphere are solar flares and sunspots
