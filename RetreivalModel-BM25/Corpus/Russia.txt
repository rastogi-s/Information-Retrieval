party managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands leon trotsky the main proponent of world revolution was exiled from the soviet union in 1929 and stalins idea of socialism in one country became the primary line the continued internal struggle in the bolshevik party culminated in the great purge a period of mass repressions in 193738 during

and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools citation needed in 1925 the government founded the league of militant atheists to intensify the persecution 82 accordingly although

unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers state bureaucrats soldiers to be openly religious as for the russian orthodox church soviet authorities sought to control it and in times of national crisis to exploit it for the regimes own purposes but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it during the first five years of soviet power the bolsheviks executed 28 russian orthodox bishops

germans were dealt major defeats first at the battle of stalingrad in the winter of 194243 84 and then in the battle of kursk in the summer of 1943 another german failure was the siege of leningrad in

after a communist-led revolution in afghanistan soviet forces entered that country the occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results ultimately the soviet army was withdrawn from afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition persistent anti-soviet guerilla warfare and a lack of support by soviet citizens from 1985 onwards the last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who sought to enact liberal reforms in the soviet system introduced the policies of glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government this however led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements prior to 1991 the soviet economy was the second largest in the world

in the world by nominal gdp and the 6th largest by purchasing power parity ppp since the turn of the 21st century higher domestic consumption and greater political stability have bolstered economic growth in russia the country ended 2008 with its ninth straight year of growth but growth has slowed with the decline in the price of oil and gas real gdp per capita ppp current international was

is about 7 184 after the united states the european union and other countries imposed economic sanctions after the annexation of crimea and a collapse in oil prices the proportion of middle-class could decrease drastically 185 oil natural gas metals and timber account for more than 80 of russian exports abroad 105 since 2003 the exports of natural resources started decreasing in economic importance as the internal market strengthened considerably as of 2012 update the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16 of gdp 52 of federal budget revenues and over 80 of total exports 186 187 188 oil

massive debts 191 leaving it with one of the lowest foreign debts among major economies 192 the stabilization fund helped russia to come out of the global financial crisis in a much better state than many experts had expected 190 a simpler more streamlined tax code adopted in 2001 reduced the tax burden on people and dramatically increased state revenue 193 russia has a flat tax rate of 13 this ranks it as the country with the second most attractive personal tax system for single managers in the world after the united arab emirates 194 according to bloomberg russia is considered well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic development with a long tradition of education science and industry 195 the country has a higher proportion of higher education graduates than any other country in eurasia 196 the economic development of the country has been uneven geographically with the moscow region contributing a very large share of the countrys gdp 197 inequality of household income and wealth has also been noted with credit suisse finding russian wealth distribution so much more extreme than other countries studied it deserves to be placed in a separate category 198 199 another problem is modernisation of infrastructure ageing and inadequate after years of being neglected in the 1990s the government has said 1trillion will be invested in development of infrastructure by 2020 200 in december 2011 russia finally clarification needed joined the world trade organisation allowing it a greater access to overseas markets some analysts estimate that wto

significant problem 203 impacting all aspects of life including public administration 204 205 law enforcement 206 healthcare 207 and education 208 the phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the historical model of public governance in russia and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in russia 204 according to 2016 results of corruption perception index of transparency international russia ranked 131th place out of 176 countries with score 29 209 there are many different estimates of the actual cost of corruption 210 according to official government statistics from rosstat the shadow economy occupied only 15 of russias gdp in 2011 and this included unreported salaries to avoid taxes and social payments and other types of tax evasion 211 according to rosstats estimates corruption in 2011 amounted to only 3.5 to 7 of gdp in comparison some independent experts maintain that corruption consumes as much of 25 of russias gdp 212 a world bank report puts this figure at 48 213 there is also an interesting shift in the main focus of bribery whereas previously officials took bribes to shut their eyes to legal infractions they now take them simply to perform their duties 214 many experts admit that in recent years corruption in russia has become a business in the 1990s businessmen had to pay different criminal groups to provide a krysha literally a roof ie protection nowadays this protective function is performed by officials corrupt hierarchies characterize different sectors of the economy 210 including education 210 in the end the russian population pays for this corruption 210 for example some experts believe that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing water gas and electricity which significantly outpace the rate of inflation are a direct result of high volumes of corruption at the highest levels 215 in the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed starting from putins second term very few corruption cases have been the subject of outrage putins system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business as well as its use of relatives friends and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property corporate property and land raiding is commonplace 210 on march 26 2017 protests against alleged corruption in the federal russian government took place simultaneously in many cities across the country 216 they were triggered by the lack of proper response from the russian authorities to the published investigative film he is not dimon to you

ruble in 2015 according to a stress test conducted by the central bank russian financial system would be able to handle a currency decline of 2530 without major central bank interference however the russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the war in donbass is in danger of entering stagflation slow growth and high inflation the recent decline in the russian ruble has increased the costs for russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in us dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble thus it costs russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies 218 as of march 2016 the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since july 2014 219 moreover after bringing inflation down to 3.6 in 2012 the lowest rate since gaining independence from the soviet union inflation in russia jumped to nearly 7.5 in 2014 causing the central bank to increase its

and continues to grow 227 this restoration of agriculture was supported by a credit policy of the government helping both individual farmers and large privatized corporate farms that once were soviet kolkhozes and which still own the significant share of agricultural land 228 while large farms concentrate mainly on grain production and husbandry products small private household plots produce most of the countrys potatoes vegetables and fruits 229 since russia borders three oceans the atlantic arctic and pacific russian fishing fleets are a major world fish supplier russia captured 3191068 tons
