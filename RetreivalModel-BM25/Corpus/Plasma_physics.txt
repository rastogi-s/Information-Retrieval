plasma physics wikipedia plasma physics for other uses see plasma plasma from ancient greek meaning moldable substance 1 is one of the four fundamental states of matter and was first described by chemist irving langmuir 2 in the 1920s 3 unlike the other three states solid liquid and gas plasma does not exist freely on the earths surface under normal conditions plasma can only be artificially generated by heating or subjecting a neutral gas to a strong electromagnetic field to the point an ionised gaseous substance becomes increasingly electrically conductive and long-range electromagnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter 4 plasma and ionised gases have unique properties and display behaviors unlike those of the other states and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature 2 and subject to interpretation 5 based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma 6 while the interior of the sun is an example of fully ionised plasma 7 along with the solar corona 8 and stars 9 positive charges in ions is achieved by stripping away electrons orbiting the atomic nuclei where the total number of electrons removed is only related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionised matter this also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds 10 though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of shared ions in metals the response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices such as plasma televisions or plasma etching 11 plasma may be the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe 12 although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter plasma is mostly associated with stars extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions 13 history edit the word plasma comes from the ancient greek meaning moldable substance 1 or jelly 2 whose usage describes the behaviour of the ionised atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma very simply each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons plasma was first identified in a crookes tube and so described by sir william crookes in 1879 he called it radiant matter 14 the nature of this cathode ray matter was subsequently identified by british physicist sir jj thomson in 1897 15 the term plasma was coined by irving langmuir in 1928 16 lewi tonks and harold mott-smith both of whom worked with irving langmuir in the 1920s recall that langmuir first used the word plasma in analogy with blood 17 18 mott-smith recalls in particular that the transport of electrons from thermionic filaments reminded langmuir of the way blood plasma carries red and white corpuscles and germs 19 langmuir described the plasma he observed as follows except near the electrodes where there are sheaths containing very few electrons the ionised gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small we shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons 16 properties and parameters edit definition edit plasma is a state of matter in which an ionised gaseous substance becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter 21 22 this state can be contrasted with the other states solid liquid and gas unlike these other states of matter plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the earths surface under normal conditions and must be artificially generated from neutral gases 4 plasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles ie the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero although these particles are unbound they are not free in the sense of not experiencing forces moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges in turn this governs collective behavior with many degrees of variation 10 23 three factors define a plasma 24 25 the plasma approximation the plasma approximation applies when the plasma parameter 26 representing the number of charge carriers within a sphere called the debye sphere whose radius is the debye screening length surrounding a given charged particle is sufficiently high as to shield the electrostatic influence of the particle outside of the sphere 21 22 bulk interactions the debye screening length defined above is short compared to the physical size of the plasma this criterion means that interactions in the bulk of the plasma are more important than those at its edges where boundary effects may take place when this criterion is satisfied the plasma is quasineutral 27 plasma frequency the electron plasma frequency measuring plasma oscillations of the electrons is large compared to the electron-neutral collision frequency measuring frequency of collisions between electrons and neutral particles when this condition is valid electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kinetics 28 degree of ionisation edit for plasma to exist ionisation is necessary the term plasma density by itself usually refers to the electron density that is the number of free electrons per unit volume the degree of ionisation of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons and is controlled mostly by the temperature even a partially ionised gas in which as little as 1 of the particles are ionised can have the characteristics of a plasma ie response to magnetic fields and high electrical conductivity the degree of ionisation is defined as where is the number density of ions and is the number density of neutral atoms the electron density is related to this by the average charge state of the ions through where is the number density of electrons temperatures edit see also nonthermal plasma and anisothermal plasma plasma temperature is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is informally a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle high temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation which is a defining feature of a plasma the degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy and more weakly by the density in a relationship called the saha equation at low temperatures ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound statesatoms 29 and the plasma will eventually become a gas in most cases the electrons are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined even when there is a significant deviation from a maxwellian energy distribution function for example due to uv radiation energetic particles or strong electric fields because of the large difference in mass the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms for this reason the ion temperature may be very different from usually lower than the electron temperature this is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas where the ions are often near the ambient temperature thermal vs nonthermal plasmas edit based on the relative temperatures of the electrons ions and neutrals plasmas are classified as thermal or non-thermal thermal plasmas have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature ie they are in thermal equilibrium with each other nonthermal plasmas on the other hand have the ions and neutrals at a much lower temperature sometimes room temperature whereas electrons are much hotter 30 complete vs incomplete ionisation edit a plasma is sometimes referred to as being hot if it is nearly fully ionised or cold if only a small fraction for example 1 of the gas molecules are ionised but other definitions of the terms hot plasma and cold plasma are common even in a cold plasma the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees celsius plasmas utilized in plasma technology technological plasmas are usually cold plasmas in the sense that only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionised 31 plasma potential edit since plasmas are very good electrical conductors electric potentials play an important role clarification needed the potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles independent of the question of how it can be measured is called the plasma potential or the space potential if an electrode is inserted into a plasma its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a debye sheath the good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small this results in the important concept of quasineutrality which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma but on the scale of the debye length there can be charge imbalance in the special case that double layers are formed the charge separation can extend some tens of debye lengths citation needed the magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net charge density a common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the boltzmann relation differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density it is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral an electron beam for example has only negative charges the density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low or it must be very small otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force 33 in astrophysical plasmas debye screening prevents electric fields from directly affecting the plasma over large distances ie greater than the debye length however the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate and be affected by magnetic fields this can and does cause extremely complex behavior such as the generation of plasma double layers an object that separates charge over a few tens of debye lengths the dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics 34 magnetization edit plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized a common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision ie where is the electron gyrofrequency and is the electron collision rate it is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not magnetized plasmas are anisotropic meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it while electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by where is the electric field is the velocity and is the magnetic field and is not affected by debye shielding 35 comparison of plasma and gas phases edit plasma is often called the fourth state of matter after solid liquids and gases despite plasma typically being an ionised gas 36 37 38 it is distinct from these and other lower-energy states of matter although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume it differs in a number of ways including the following plasmas in astronomy and astrophysics edit further information astrophysical plasma interstellar medium and intergalactic space plasmas are by far the most common phase of ordinary matter in the universe both by mass and by volume 40 within our solar system interplanetary space is filled with the plasma expelled via the solar wind extending from the suns surface out to the heliopause furthermore all the distant stars and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma albeit at very low densities astrophysical plasmas are also observed in accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs neutron stars or black holes in close binary star systems 41 plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets which have been observed with accreting black holes 42 or in active galaxies like m87s jet that possibly extends out to 5000 light-years 43 common plasmas edit plasmas can appear in nature in various forms and locations which can be usefully broadly summarised in the following table complex plasma phenomena edit although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple plasma behavior is extraordinarily varied and subtle the emergence of unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex system such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple smooth mathematical functions or by pure randomness the spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity the features are interesting for example because they are very sharp spatially intermittent the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves or have a fractal form many of these features were first studied in the laboratory and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include filamentation edit striations or string-like structures 45 also known as birkeland currents are seen in many plasmas like the plasma ball the aurora 46 lightning 47 electric arcs solar flares 48 and supernova remnants 49 they are sometimes associated with larger current densities and the interaction with the magnetic field can form a magnetic rope structure 50 high power microwave breakdown at atmospheric pressure also leads to the formation of filamentary structures 51 see also plasma pinch filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse at high powers the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam where the laser is brighter than at the edges causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more the tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness irradiance that forms a plasma the plasma has an index of refraction lower than one and causes a defocusing of the laser beam the interplay of the focusing index of refraction and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be micrometers to kilometers in length 52 one interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionised electrons 53 see also filament propagation non-neutral plasma edit the strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal quasineutrality a plasma with a significant excess of charge density or in the extreme case is composed of a single species is called a non-neutral plasma in such a plasma electric fields play a dominant role examples are charged particle beams an electron cloud in a penning trap and positron plasmas 54 dusty plasmagrain plasma edit a dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust typically found in space the dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other a plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma under laboratory conditions dusty plasmas are also called complex plasmas 55 impermeable plasma edit impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by hannes alfvn in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls 56 however later it was found that the external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls 57 in 2013 a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas while spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement they also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating known as viscous heating leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials 58 mathematical descriptions edit main article plasma modeling to completely describe the state of a plasma all of the particle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down however it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma therefore plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions of which there are two main types fluid model edit fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities like density and averaged velocity around each position see plasma parameters one simple fluid model magnetohydrodynamics treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of maxwells equations and the navierstokes equations a more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture where the ions and electrons are described separately fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a maxwellboltzmann distribution because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers nor resolve wave-particle effects kinetic model edit kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a maxwellboltzmann distribution a kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas there are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma one is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position the other known as the particle-in-cell pic technique includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models the vlasov equation may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field in magnetized plasmas a gyrokinetic approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation artificial plasmas edit most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric andor magnetic fields through a gas plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by the type of power source used to generate the plasmadc rf and microwave the pressure they operate atvacuum pressure 10mtorr or 1 pa moderate pressure 1torr or 100 pa atmospheric pressure 760torr or 100 kpa the degree of ionisation within the plasmafully partially or weakly ionised the temperature relationships within the plasmathermal plasma non-thermal or cold plasma the electrode configuration used to generate the plasma the magnetization of the particles within the plasmamagnetized both ion and electrons are trapped in larmor orbits by the magnetic field partially magnetized the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field non-magnetized the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate lorentz forces citation needed generation of artificial plasma edit just like the many uses of plasma there are several means for its generation however one principle is common to all of them there must be energy input to produce and sustain it 60 for this case plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid an electrically non-conducting material as can be seen in the adjacent image which shows a discharge tube as a simple example dc used for simplicity the potential difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons negative toward the anode positive electrode while the cathode negative electrode pulls the nucleus 61 as the voltage increases the current stresses the material by electric polarization beyond its dielectric limit termed strength into a stage of electrical breakdown marked by an electric spark where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor as it becomes increasingly ionised the underlying process is the townsend avalanche where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons as can be seen in the figure on the right the first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons therefore the number of charged particles increases rapidly in the millions only after about 20 successive sets of collisions 62 mainly due to a small mean free path average distance travelled between collisions electric arc edit with ample current density and ionisation this forms a luminous electric arc a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning between the electrodes note 1 electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat which dissociates more gas molecules and ionises the resulting atoms where degree of ionisation is determined by temperature and as per the sequence solid liquid gas plasma the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma note 2 a thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles ie atoms molecules and ions and electrons this is so because when thermal plasmas are generated electrical energy is given to electrons which due to their great mobility and large numbers are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision without energy loss to the heavy particles 63 note 3 examples of industrialcommercial plasma edit because of their sizable temperature and density ranges plasmas find applications in many fields of research technology and industry for example in industrial and extractive metallurgy 63 64 surface treatments such as plasma spraying coating etching in microelectronics 65 metal cutting 66 and welding as well as in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent luminescent lamps 60 fuel ignition while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering 67 low-pressure discharges edit glow discharge plasmas non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of dc or low frequency rf 100khz electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes probably the most common plasma this is the type of plasma generated within fluorescent light tubes 68 capacitively coupled plasma ccp similar to glow discharge plasmas but generated with high frequency rf electric fields typically 1356mhz these differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less intense these are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition 69 cascaded arc plasma source a device to produce low temperature 1ev high density plasmas hdp inductively coupled plasma icp similar to a ccp and with similar applications but the electrode consists of a coil wrapped around the chamber where plasma is formed 70 wave heated plasma similar to ccp and icp in that it is typically rf or microwave examples include helicon discharge and electron cyclotron resonance ecr 71 atmospheric pressure edit arc discharge this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature 10000 k it can be generated using various power supplies it is commonly used in metallurgical processes for example it is used to smelt minerals containing al 2 o 3 to produce aluminium corona discharge this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips it is commonly used in ozone generators and particle precipitators dielectric barrier discharge dbd this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc it is often mislabeled corona discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges it is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics 72 the application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints glues and similar materials to adhere 73 the dielectric barrier discharge was used in the mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells 74 this work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine the dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets these plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionisation waves known as plasma bullets 75 capacitive discharge this is a nonthermal plasma generated by the application of rf power eg 1356mhz to one powered electrode with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance on the order of 1cm such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon 76 piezoelectric direct discharge plasma is a nonthermal plasma generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer pt this generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired research edit plasmas are the object of study of the academic field of plasma science or plasma physics including sub-disciplines such as space plasma physics it currently involves the following fields of active research and features across many journals whose interest includes research examples
