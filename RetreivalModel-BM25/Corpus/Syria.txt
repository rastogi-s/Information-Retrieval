islamic era damascus was the seat of the umayyad caliphate and a provincial capital of the mamluk sultanate in egypt the modern syrian state was established after the end of centuries of ottoman control in world war i as a french mandate and represented the largest arab state to emerge from the formerly ottoman ruled arab levant it gained independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 october 1945 when syria became a founding member of the united nations an act which legally ended the former french mandate although french troops did not leave the country until april 1946 the post-independence period was tumultuous and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 194971 in 1958 syria entered a brief union with egypt called the united arab republic which was terminated by the 1961 syrian coup dtat the arab republic of syria came into being in late 1961 after december 1 constitutional referendum and was increasingly unstable until

derived from the 8th century bc luwian term surai and the derivative ancient greek name srioi or sroi both of which originally derived from aryu assyria in northern mesopotamia 20 21 however from the seleucid empire 323150 bc this term was also applied to the levant and from this point the greeks applied the term without distinction between the assyrians of mesopotamia and arameans of the levant 22 23 mainstream modern academic opinion strongly favours the argument that the greek word is related to the cognate assyria ultimately derived from the akkadian aur 24 the greek name appears to correspond to phoenician r assur rym assyrians recorded in the 8th century bc ineky inscription 25 the area designated by the word has changed over time classically syria lies at the eastern end of the mediterranean between arabia to the south and asia minor to the north stretching inland to include parts of iraq and having an uncertain border to the northeast that pliny the elder describes as including from west to east commagene sophene and adiabene 26 by plinys time however this larger syria had been divided into a number of provinces under the roman empire but politically independent from each other judaea later renamed palaestina in ad 135 the region corresponding to modern-day israel the palestinian territories and jordan in the extreme southwest phoenice established in 194 ad corresponding to modern lebanon damascus and homs regions coele-syria or hollow syria south of the eleutheris river and iraq 27 history main article history of syria ancient antiquity since approximately 10000 bc syria was one of centers of neolithic culture known as pre-pottery neolithic a where agriculture and cattle breeding appeared for the first time in the world the following neolithic period ppnb is represented by rectangular houses of mureybet culture at the time of the pre-pottery neolithic people used vessels made of stone gyps and burnt lime vaisselle blanche finds of obsidian tools from anatolia are evidences of early trade relations cities of hamoukar and emar played an important role during the late neolithic and bronze age archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in syria was one of the most ancient on earth perhaps preceded by only those of mesopotamia eblaites and amorites main articles amorite ugarit ebla yamhad qatna and mari syria the earliest recorded indigenous civilisation in the region was the kingdom of ebla 29 near present-day idlib northern syria ebla appears to have been founded around 3500 bc 30 31 32 33 34 and gradually built its fortune through trade with the mesopotamian states of sumer assyria and akkad as well as with the hurrian and hattian peoples to the northwest in asia minor 35 gifts from pharaohs found during excavations confirm eblas contact with egypt one of the earliest written texts from syria is a trading agreement between vizier ibrium of ebla and an ambiguous kingdom called abarsal c 2300 bc 36 37 scholars believe the language of ebla to be among the oldest known written semitic languages after akkadian recent classifications of the eblaite language have shown that it was an east semitic language closely related to the akkadian language 38 ebla was weakened by a long war with mari and the whole of syria became part of the mesopotamian akkadian empire after sargon of akkad and his grandson naram-sin s conquests ended eblan domination over syria in the first half of the 23rd century bc 39 40 by the 21st century bc hurrians settled the northern east parts of syria while the rest of the region was dominated by the amorites syria was called the land of the amurru amorites by their assyro-babylonian neighbors the northwest semitic language of the amorites is the earliest attested of the canaanite languages mari reemerged during this period and saw renewed prosperity until conquered by hammurabi of babylon ugarit also arose during this time circa 1800 bc close to modern latakia ugaritic was a semitic language loosely related to the canaanite languages and developed the ugaritic alphabet 41 considered to be the worlds earliest known alphabet the ugaritic kingdom survived until its destruction at the hands of the marauding indo-european sea peoples in the 12th century bc in what was known as the late bronze age collapse which saw similar kingdoms and states witness the same destruction at the hand of the sea peoples yamhad modern aleppo dominated northern syria for two centuries 42 although eastern syria was occupied in the 19th and 18th centuries bc by the old assyrian empire ruled by the amorite dynasty of shamshi-adad i and by the babylonian empire which was founded by amorites yamhad was described in the tablets of mari as the mightiest state in the near east and as having more vassals than hammurabi of babylon 42 yamhad imposed its authority over alalakh 43 qatna 44 the hurrians states and the euphrates valley down to the borders with babylon 45 the army of yamhad campaigned as far away as dr on the border of elam modern iran 46 yamhad was conquered and destroyed along with ebla by the indo-european hittites from asia minor circa 1600 bc 47 from this time syria became a battle ground for various foreign empires these being the hittite empire mitanni empire egyptian empire middle assyrian empire and to a lesser degree babylonia the egyptians initially occupied much of the south while the hittites and the mitanni much of the north however assyria eventually gained the upper hand destroying the mitanni empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the hittites and babylon arameans and phoenicians main articles arameans syro-hittite states and phoenicia around the 14th century bc various semitic peoples appeared in the area such as the semi-nomadic suteans who came into an unsuccessful conflict with babylonia to the east and the west semitic speaking arameans who subsumed the earlier amorites they too were subjugated by assyria and the hittites for centuries the egyptians fought the hittites for control over western syria the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 bc with the battle of kadesh 48 49 the west remained part of the hittite empire until its destruction c 1200 bc 50 while eastern syria largely became part of the middle assyrian empire 51 who also annexed much of the west during the reign of tiglath-pileser i 11141076 bc with the destruction of the hittites and the decline of assyria in the late 11th century bc the aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior founding states such as bit bahiani aram-damascus hamath aram-rehob aram-naharaim and luhuti from this point the region became known as aramea or aram there was also a synthesis between the semitic arameans and the remnants of the indo-european hittites with the founding of a number of syro-hittite states centered in north central aram syria and south central asia minor modern turkey including palistin carchemish and samal a canaanite group known as the phoenicians came to dominate the coasts of syria and also lebanon and northern palestine from the 13th century bc founding city states such as amrit simyra arwad paltos ramitha and shuksi from these coastal regions they eventually spread their influence throughout the mediterranean including building colonies in malta sicily the iberian peninsula modern spain and portugal the coasts of north africa and most significantly founding the major city state of carthage in modern tunisia in the 9th century bc which was much later to become the center of a major empire rivaling the roman empire syria and the entire near east and beyond then fell to the vast neo assyrian empire 911 bc 605 bc the assyrians introduced imperial aramaic as the lingua franca of their empire this language was to remain dominant in syria and the entire near east until after the arab islamic conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries ad and was to be a vehicle for the spread of christianity the assyrians named their colonies of syria and lebanon eber-nari assyrian domination ended after the assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars followed by an attacking coalition of their former subject peoples the medes babylonians chaldeans persians scythians and cimmerians during the fall of assyria the scythians ravaged and plundered much of syria the last stand of the assyrian army was at carchemish in northern syria in 605 bc the assyrian empire was followed by the neo-babylonian empire 605 bc 539 bc during this period syria became a battle ground between babylonia and another former assyrian colony that of egypt the babylonians like their assyrian relations were victorious over egypt classical antiquity main articles eber-nari coele-syria syria roman province and syria-palaestina the achaemenid empire founded by cyrus the great took syria from babylonia as part of its hegemony of southwest asia in 539 bc the persians having spent four centuries under assyrian rule retained imperial aramaic as diplomatic language in the achaemenid empire 539 bc 330 bc and also the assyrian name of the satrapy of aramsyria eber-nari syria was conquered by the greek macedonian empire ruled by alexander the great circa 330 bc and consequently became coele-syria province of the greek seleucid empire 323 bc 64 bc with the seleucid kings styling themselves king of syria and the city of antioch being its capital starting from 240 thus it was the greeks who introduced the name syria to the region originally an indo-european corruption of assyria in northern mesopotamia the greeks used this term to describe not only assyria itself but also the lands to the west which had for centuries been under assyrian dominion 52 thus in the greco-roman world both the arameans of syria and the assyrians of mesopotamia to the east were referred to as syrians or syriacs despite these being distinct peoples in their own right a confusion which would continue into the modern world eventually parts of southern seleucid syria were taken by judean hasmoneans upon the slow disintegration of the hellenistic empire syria briefly came under armenian control from 83 bc with the conquests of the armenian king tigranes the great who was welcomed as a savior from the seleucids and romans by the syrian people whatsoever pompey the great a general of the roman empire rode to syria captured antioch its capital and turned syria into a roman province in 64 bc thus ending armenian control over the region which lasted two decades syria prospered under roman rule being strategically located on the silk road which gave it massive wealth and importance making it the battleground for the rivaling romans and persians palmyra a rich and sometimes powerful native aramaic speaking kingdom arose in northern syria in the 2nd century the palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the roman empire eventually in the late 3rd century ad the palmyrene king odaenathus defeated the persian emperor shapur i and controlled the entirety of the roman east while his successor and widow zenobia established the palmyrene empire which briefly conquered egypt syria palestine much of asia minor judah and lebanon before being finally brought under roman control in 273 ad the northern mesopotamian assyrian kingdom of adiabene controlled areas of north east syria between 10 ad and 117 ad before it was conquered by rome 53 the aramaic language has been found as far afield as hadrians wall in ancient britain with inscriptions written by assyrian and aramean soldiers of the roman empire 54 control of syria eventually passed from the romans to the byzantines with the split in the roman empire 35 the largely aramaic speaking population of syria during the heyday of the byzantine empire was probably not exceeded again until the 19th century prior to the arab islamic conquest in the 7th century ad the bulk of the population were arameans but syria was also home to greek and roman ruling classes assyrians still dwelt in the north east phoenicians along the coasts and jewish and armenian communities was also extant in major cities with nabateans and pre-islamic arabs such as the lakhmids and ghassanids dwelling in the deserts of southern syria syriac christianity had taken hold as the major religion although others still followed judaism mithraism manicheanism greco-roman religion canaanite religion and mesopotamian religion syrias large and prosperous population made syria one of the most important of the roman and byzantine provinces particularly during the 2nd and 3rd centuries ad 55 syrians held considerable amounts of power during the severan dynasty the matriarch of the family and empress of rome as wife of emperor septimius severus was julia domna a syrian from the city of emesa modern day homs whose family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the god el-gabal her great nephews also arameans from syria would also become roman emperors the first being elagabalus and the second his cousin alexander severus another roman emperor who was a syrian was philip the arab marcus julius philippus who was born in roman arabia he was emperor from 244 to 249 55 and ruled briefly during the crisis of the third century during his reign he focused on his home town of philippopolis modern day shahba and began many construction projects to improve the city most of which were halted after his death syria is significant in the history of christianity saulus of tarsus better known as the apostle paul was converted on the road to damascus and emerged as a significant figure in the christian church at antioch in ancient syria from which he left on many of his missionary journeys acts 9143 middle ages during muhammads era main article list of battles of muhammad muhammad s first interaction with the people and tribes of syria was during the invasion of dumatul jandal in july 626 56 where he ordered his followers to invade duma because muhammad received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and preparing to attack medina itself 57 william montgomery watt claims that this was the most significant expedition muhammad ordered at the time even though it received little notice in the primary sources dumat al-jandal was 800 kilometres 500mi from medina and watt says that there was no immediate threat to muhammad other than the possibility that his communications to syria and supplies to medina being interrupted watt says it is tempting to suppose that muhammad was already envisaging something of the expansion which took place after his death and that the rapid march of his troops must have impressed all those who heard of it 58 william muir also believes that the expedition was important as muhammad followed by 1000 men reached the confines of syria where distant tribes had now learnt his name while the political horizon of muhammad was extended 56 islamic syria al-sham main article bilad al-sham by ad 640 syria was conquered by the arab rashidun army led by khalid ibn al-walid in the mid-7th century the umayyad dynasty then rulers of the empire placed the capital of the empire in damascus the countrys power declined during later umayyad rule this was mainly due to totalitarianism corruption and the resulting revolutions the umayyad dynasty was then overthrown in 750 by the abbasid dynasty which moved the capital of empire to baghdad arabic made official under umayyad rule became the dominant language replacing greek and aramaic of the byzantine era in 887 the egypt-based tulunids annexed syria from the abbasids and were later replaced by once the egypt-based ikhshidids and still later by the hamdanids originating in aleppo founded by sayf al-dawla 59 crusaders ayubids mamluks and nizaris sections of syria were held by french english italian and german overlords between 1098 and 1189 ad during the crusades and were known collectively as the crusader states among which the primary one in syria was the principality of antioch the coastal mountainous region was also occupied in part by the nizari ismailis the so-called assassins who had intermittent confrontations and truces with the crusader states later in history when the nizaris faced renewed frankish hostilities they received timely assistance from the ayyubids 60 after a century of seljuk rule syria was largely conquered 11751185 by the kurdish warlord saladin founder of the ayyubid dynasty of egypt aleppo fell to the mongols of hulegu in january 1260 and damascus in march but then hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to china to deal with a succession dispute a few months later the mamluks arrived with an army from egypt and defeated the mongols in the battle of ain jalut in galilee the mamluk leader baibars made damascus a provincial capital when he died power was taken by qalawun in the meantime an emir named sunqur al-ashqar had tried to declare himself ruler of damascus but he was defeated by qalawun on 21 june 1280 and fled to northern syria al-ashqar who had married a mongol woman appealed for help from the mongols the mongols of the ilkhanate took the city but qalawun persuaded al-ashqar to join him and they fought against the mongols on 29 october 1281 in the second battle of homs which was won by the mamluks 61 in 1400 the muslim turco-mongol conqueror timur lenk tamurlane invaded syria sacked aleppo and captured damascus after defeating the mamluk army the citys inhabitants were massacred except for the artisans who were deported to samarkand timur-lenk also conducted specific massacres of the aramean and assyrian christian populations greatly reducing their numbers 62 63 by the end of the 15th century the discovery of a sea route from europe to the far east ended the need for an overland trade route through syria ottoman syria main article ottoman syria in 1516 the ottoman empire invaded the mamluk sultanate of egypt conquering syria and incorporating it into its empire the ottoman system was not burdensome to syrians because the turks respected arabic as the language of the quran and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith damascus was made the major entrepot for mecca and as such it acquired a holy character to muslims because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca 64 ottoman administration followed a system that led to peaceful coexistence each ethno-religious minority arab shia muslim arab sunni muslim aramean syriac orthodox greek orthodox maronite christians assyrian christians

provinces vilayets of aleppo zor beirut and damascus vilayet mutasarrifate of mount lebanon was created as well and soon after the mutasarrifate of jerusalem was given a separate status during world war i the ottoman empire entered the conflict on the side of germany and the austro-hungarian empire it ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire near east to the british empire and french empire during the conflict genocide against indigenous christian peoples was carried out by the ottomans and their allies in the form of the armenian genocide and assyrian genocide of which deir ez-zor in ottoman syria was the final destination of these death marches 66 in the midst of world war i two allied diplomats frenchman franois georges-picot and briton mark sykes secretly agreed on the post-war division of the ottoman empire into respective zones of influence in the sykes-picot agreement of 1916 initially the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from jordan to iran however the discovery of oil in the region of mosul just before the end of the war led to yet another negotiation with france in 1918 to cede this region to zone b or the british zone of influence this border was later recognized internationally when syria became a league of nations mandate in 1920 67 and has not changed to date french mandate main article french mandate for syria and lebanon in 1920 a short-lived independent kingdom of syria was established under faisal i of the hashemite family however his rule over syria ended after only a few months following the battle of maysalun french troops occupied syria later that year after the san remo conference proposed that the league of nations put syria under a french mandate general gouraud had according to his secretary de caix two options either build a syrian nation that does not exist by smoothing the rifts which still divide it or cultivate and maintain all the phenomena which require our abitration that these divisions give de caix added i must say only the second option interests me this is what gouraud did 68 69 in 1925 sultan al-atrash led a revolt that broke out in the druze mountain and spread to engulf the whole of syria and parts of lebanon al-atrash won several battles against the french notably the battle of al-kafr on 21 july 1925 the battle of al-mazraa on 23 august 1925 and the battles of salkhad al-musayfirah and suwayda france sent thousands of troops from morocco and senegal leading the french to regain many cities although resistance lasted until the spring of 1927 the french sentenced sultan al-atrash to death but he had escaped with the rebels to transjordan and was eventually pardoned he returned to syria in 1937 after the signing of the syrian-french treaty syria and france negotiated a treaty of independence in september 1936 and hashim al-atassi was the first president to be elected under the first incarnation of the modern republic of syria however the treaty never came into force because the french legislature refused to ratify it with the fall of france in 1940 during world war ii syria came under the control of vichy france until the british and free french occupied the country in the syria-lebanon campaign in july 1941 continuing pressure from syrian nationalists and the british forced the french to evacuate

united arab republic and 1963 syrian coup dtat upheaval dominated syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s in may 1948 syrian forces invaded palestine together with other arab states and immediately attacked jewish settlements 71 their president shukri al-quwwatli instructed his troops in the front to destroy the zionists 72 73 the invasion purpose was prevention of the establishment of the state of israel 74 defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the march 1949 syrian coup dtat by col husni al-zaim described as the first military overthrow of the arab world 74 since the start of the second world war this was soon followed by another overthrow by col sami al-hinnawi who was himself quickly deposed by col adib shishakli all within the same year 74 shishakli eventually abolished multipartyism altogether but was himself overthrown in a 1954 coup and the parliamentary system was restored 74 however by this time power was increasingly concentrated in the military and security establishment 74 the weakness of parliamentary institutions and the mismanagement of the economy led to unrest and the influence of nasserism and other ideologies there was fertile ground for various arab nationalist syrian nationalist and socialist movements which represented disaffected elements of society notably included were religious minorities who demanded radical reform 74 in november 1956 as a direct result of the suez crisis 75 syria signed a pact with the soviet union this gave a foothold for communist influence within the government in exchange for military equipment 74 turkey then became worried about this increase in the strength of syrian military technology as it seemed feasible that syria might attempt to retake skenderun only heated debates in the united nations lessened the threat of war 76 on 1 february 1958 syrian president shukri al-quwatli and egypts nasser announced the merging of egypt and syria creating the united arab republic and all syrian political parties as well as the communists therein ceased overt activities 70 meanwhile a group of syrian baathist officers alarmed by the partys poor position and the

out an intra-party overthrow imprisoned president amin hafiz and designated a regionalist civilian baath government on 1 march 74 although nureddin al-atassi became the formal head of state salah jadid was syrias effective ruler from 1966 until november 1970 77 when he was deposed by hafez al-assad who at the time was minister of defense 78 the coup led to a split within the original pan-arab baath party one iraqi-led baath movement ruled iraq from 1968 to 2003 and one syrian-led baath movement was established in the first half of 1967 a low-key state of war existed between syria and israel conflict over israeli cultivation of land in the demilitarized zone led to 7 april pre-war aerial clashes between israel and syria 79 when the six-day war broke out between egypt and israel syria joined the war and attacked israel as well in the final days of the war israel turned its attention to syria capturing two-thirds of the golan heights in under 48 hours 80 the defeat caused a split between jadid and assad over what steps to take next 81 disagreement developed between jadid who controlled the party apparatus and assad who controlled the military the 1970 retreat of syrian forces sent to aid the plo during the black september hostilities with jordan reflected this disagreement 82 the power struggle culminated in the november 1970 syrian corrective revolution a bloodless military overthrow that installed hafez al-assad as the strongman of the government 78 on 6 october 1973 syria and egypt initiated the yom kippur war against israel the israel defense forces reversed the initial syrian gains and pushed deeper into syrian territory 83 in early 1976 syria entered lebanon beginning the thirty-year syrian military occupation over the following 15 years of civil war syria fought for control over lebanon syria then remained in lebanon until 2005 in the late 1970s an islamist uprising by the muslim brotherhood was aimed against the government islamists attacked
