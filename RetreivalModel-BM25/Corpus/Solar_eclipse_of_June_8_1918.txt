solar eclipse of june 8 1918 wikipedia solar eclipse of june 8 1918 a total solar eclipse occurred on june 8 1918 the eclipse was observed by a us naval observatory team at baker city in oregon the painting below shows totality when the moon prevented the suns rays from hitting that part of oregon the track of the eclipse was a band across the entire contiguous united states the path edit the path of the eclipse started south of japan went across the pacific ocean passing northern part of kitadait okinawa and the whole tori-shima in izu islands on june 9 and then across the united states and british bahamas todays bahamas on june 8 the largest city to see totality was denver although many could theoretically see it as the size of the shadow was between 70 and 44 miles 113 and 71km across as it traveled across america the longest duration of totality was in the pacific at a point south of alaska the path of the eclipse finished near bermuda 1 us observation team edit the path clipped washington state and then moved across the whole of oregon through the rest of the country exiting over florida the us naval observatory usno obtained a special grant of 3500 from congress for a team to observe the eclipse in baker city oregon the team had been making preparations since the year before and john c hammond led the first members to baker city on april 11th 2 the location was important as it influenced the probability of cloud cover and the duration and angle of the sun during the eclipse the team included samuel alfred mitchell as its expert on eclipses and howard russell butler an artist and physicist in a time before reliable colour photography butlers role was to paint the eclipse at totality after observing it for 112.1 seconds 3 he noted later that he used a system of taking notes of the colours using skills he had learned for transient effects 3 joel stebbins and jakob kunz from the university of illinois observatory made the first photoelectric photometric observations of the solar corona from their observing site near rock springs wyoming 4 observation edit as the time came for totality the team watched as clouds obscured the sun the clouds did clear but during their most important observations the sun was covered by a thin cloud the sun was completely visible five minutes later 2 this was not unusual as cloudy conditions were reported across the country where the eclipse was also observed from the yerkes observatory lick observatory and mount wilson observatory 5 following the 1915 prediction of albert einstein s general theory of relativity that light would be deflected when passing near a massive object such as the sun the usno expedition attempted to validate einsteins prediction of light bending by the sun by measuring the position of stars near the sun however the cloud cover during totality obscured observations of stars 6 leaving this test of the validity of general relativity until the solar eclipse of may 29 1919 related eclipses edit there were two other eclipses that year the first was a partial lunar eclipse during which the shadow of the earth can be seen on the moon and another solar eclipse that took place on december 3 over south america 1 the other solar eclipse however was an annular eclipse which occurs when the moon has a smaller apparent diameter and therefore never fully obscures the sun solar eclipses of 19161920 edit each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit
