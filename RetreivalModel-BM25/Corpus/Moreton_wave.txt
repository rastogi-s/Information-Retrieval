moreton wave wikipedia moreton wave a moreton wave or moreton-ramsey wave is the chromospheric signature of a large-scale solar coronal shock wave described as a kind of solar tsunami 1 they are generated by solar flares they are named for american astronomer gail moreton an observer at the lockheed solar observatory in burbank and harry e ramsey an observer who spotted them in 1959 at the sacramento peak observatory 2 3 4 he discovered them in time-lapse photography of the chromosphere in the light of the balmer alpha transition there were few follow-up studies for decades then the 1995 launch of the solar and heliospheric observatory led to observation of coronal waves which cause moreton waves moreton waves were a research topic again sohos eit instrument discovered another different wave type called eit waves 5 the reality of moreton waves aka fast-mode mhd waves has also been confirmed by the two stereo spacecraft they observed a 100000-km-high wave of hot plasma and magnetism moving at 250kms in conjunction with a big coronal mass ejection in february 2009 6 7 moreton measured the waves propagating at a speed of 5001500kms 6 yutaka uchida interpreted moreton waves as mhd fast mode shock waves propagating in the corona 8 he links them to type ii radio bursts which are radio-wave discharges created when coronal mass ejections accelerate shocks 9 moreton waves can be observed primarily in the h band 10
