covered up old craters and then cooled becoming smooth basalt rock 11 the near side of the moon containing these maria that make up the man is always facing earth this is due to a tidal locking or synchronous orbit thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the moons oblong shape its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the earth this causes the near side of the moon to always turn its face toward earth 12
