danube and the balkan establishing their capital at pliska 36 37 a peace treaty with byzantium in 681 marked the beginning of the first bulgarian empire the bulgars gradually mixed with the local population adopting a common language on the basis of the local slavic dialect 38 succeeding rulers strengthened the bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries krum doubled the countrys territory killed byzantine emperor nicephorus i in the battle of pliska 39 and introduced the first written code of law paganism was abolished in favour of eastern orthodox christianity under boris i in 864 this conversion was followed by a byzantine recognition of the bulgarian church 40 and the adoption of the cyrillic alphabet developed at preslav 41 which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the slavs and bulgars into a unified people 42 43 a subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of simeon the great who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state 44 wars with magyars and pechenegs and the spread of the bogomil heresy weakened bulgaria after simeons death 45 46 consecutive rus and byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital preslav by the byzantine army in 971 47 under samuil bulgaria briefly recovered from these attacks 48 but this rise ended when byzantine emperor basil ii defeated the bulgarian army at klyuch in 1014 samuil died shortly after the battle 49 and by 1018 the byzantines had ended the first bulgarian empire 50 second bulgarian empire main article second bulgarian empire after his conquest of bulgaria basil ii prevented revolts and discontent by retaining the rule of the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold allowing them to be paid in kind instead 51 he also allowed the bulgarian patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses but reduced it to an archbishopric 51 52 after his death byzantine domestic

his dominion to belgrade and ohrid he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate 54 the empire reached its zenith under ivan asen ii 12181241 when commerce and culture flourished 54 the strong economic and religious influence of tarnovo made it a third rome unlike the already declining constantinople 55 the countrys military and economic might declined after the asen dynasty ended in 1257 facing internal conflicts constant byzantine and hungarian attacks and mongol domination 54 56 by the end of the 14th century factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of bogomilism had caused the second bulgarian empire to split into three tsardoms vidin tarnovo and karvuna and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other along with byzantines hungarians serbs venetians and genoese by the late 14th century the ottoman turks had started their conquest of bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south

fall of the vidin tsardom the ottomans conquered all bulgarian lands south of the danube the nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to ottoman masters 57 with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries 58 under the ottoman system christians were considered an inferior class of people thus bulgarians like other christians were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete islamisation 59 and their culture was suppressed 58 ottoman authorities established the rum millet a religious administrative community which governed all orthodox christians regardless of their ethnicity 60 most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness identifying as christians 61 62 however the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive and that helped it to survive as in some rural remote areas 63 as well as in the militant catholic community in the northwestern part of the country 64 several bulgarian revolts erupted throughout the nearly five centuries of ottoman rule most notably the habsburg backed 65 tarnovo uprisings in 1598 and in 1686 the chiprovtsi uprising in 1688 and karposhs rebellion in 1689 57 in the 18th century the enlightenment in western europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the national awakening of bulgaria 57 it restored national consciousness and became a key factor in the liberation struggle resulting in the 1876 april uprising up to 30000 bulgarians were killed as ottoman authorities put down the rebellion the massacres prompted the great powers to take action 66 they convened the constantinople conference in 1876 but their decisions were rejected by the ottomans this allowed the russian empire to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other great powers as had happened in the crimean war 66 in 1877 russia declared war on the ottoman empire and defeated its forces with the help of bulgarian volunteers third bulgarian state main articles history of bulgaria 18781946 peoples republic of bulgaria and history of bulgaria since 1989 the treaty of san stefano was signed on 3 march 1878 by russia and the ottoman empire and included a provision to set up an autonomous bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the second bulgarian empire 68 69 3 march has since become liberation day a public holiday in bulgaria 70 though the holiday was suppressed and fell out of favour following the left-wing uprising in 1944 71 the other great powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the balkans might threaten their interests it was superseded by the subsequent treaty of berlin signed on 13 july which provided for a much smaller state comprising moesia and the region of sofia leaving large populations of bulgarians outside the new country 68 72 this played a significant role in forming bulgarias militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century 73 the bulgarian principality won a war against serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous ottoman territory of eastern rumelia in 1885 proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 october 1908 74 in the years following independence bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as the

achieving several decisive victories at doiran and dobrich the country capitulated in 1918 the war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87500 soldiers killed 79 more than 253000 refugees immigrated to bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars 80 placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy 81 the political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by tsar boris iii 19181943 bulgaria entered world war ii in 1941 as a member of the axis but declined to participate in operation barbarossa and saved its jewish population from deportation to concentration camps 82 the sudden death of boris iii in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum the government of bogdan filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the allies bulgaria did not comply with soviet demands to expel german forces from its territory resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the ussr in september 1944 83 the communist-dominated fatherland front took power ended participation in the axis and joined the allied side until the war ended 84 the left-wing uprising of 9 september 1944 led to the abolition of monarchic rule but it was not until 1946 that a one-party peoples republic was

per capita gdps quadrupled 91 but the economy remained prone to debt spikes the most severe taking place in 1960 1977 and 1980 92 the soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under todor zhivkov 19541989 93 his daughter lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting bulgarian heritage culture and arts worldwide 94 in an attempt to erase the identity of the ethnic turk minority an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic turks to adopt slavic names these policies combined with the end of communist rule in 1989 resulted in the emigration of some 300000 ethnic turks to turkey 95 96 under the influence of the collapsing of the eastern bloc on 10 november 1989 the communist party gave up its political monopoly zhivkov resigned and bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy 97 the first free elections in june 1990 were won by the bulgarian socialist party bsp the freshly renamed communist party 98 a new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in july 1991 the
