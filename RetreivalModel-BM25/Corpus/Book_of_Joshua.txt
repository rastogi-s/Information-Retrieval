book of joshua wikipedia book of joshua this article is about the canonical book of the hebrew bible for information on the samaritan version see book of joshua samaritan the book of joshua hebrew sefer yhsha is the sixth book in the hebrew bible the christian old testament and the first book of the deuteronomistic history the story of israel from the conquest of canaan to the babylonian exile 1 42 it tells of the campaigns of the israelites in central southern and northern canaan the destruction of their enemies and the division of the land among the twelve tribes framed by two set-piece speeches the first by god commanding the conquest of the land and at the end the last by joshua warning of the need for faithful observance of the law torah revealed to moses 2 almost all scholars agree that the book of joshua holds little historical value for early israel and most likely reflects a much later period 3 152 although rabbinic tradition holds that the book was written by joshua it is probable that it was written by multiple authors and editors far removed from the times it depicts 4 9-10 the earliest parts of the book are possibly chapters 211 the story of the conquest these chapters were later incorporated into an early form of joshua written late in the reign of king josiah reigned 640609bce but the book was not completed until after the fall of jerusalem to the neo-babylonian empire in 586 bce and possibly not until after the return from the babylonian exile in 539 bce 4 1011 contents edit structure edit i transfer of leadership to joshua 1118 a gods

first of three important moments in joshua marked with major speeches and reflections by the main characters here first god and then joshua make speeches about the goal of conquest of the promised land in chapter 12 the narrator looks back on the conquest and in chapter 23 joshua gives a speech about what must be done if israel is to live in peace in the land 5 49 god commissions joshua to take possession of the land and warns him to keep faith with the covenant gods speech foreshadows the major themes of the book the crossing of the jordan river and conquest of the land its distribution and the imperative need for obedience to the law joshuas own immediate obedience is seen in his speeches to the israelite commanders and to the transjordanian tribes and the transjordanians affirmation of joshuas leadership echoes yahweh s assurances of victory 6 175 entry into the land and conquest chapters 212 edit the israelites cross the jordan river through the miraculous intervention of god and the ark of the covenant then they are circumcised at gibeath-haaraloth translated as hill of foreskins renamed gilgal in memory gilgal sounds like gallothi i have removed but is more likely to translate as circle of standing stones the conquest begins in canaan with jericho followed by ai central canaan after which joshua builds an altar to yahweh at mount ebal northern canaan and renews the covenant the covenant ceremony has elements of a divine land-grant ceremony similar to ceremonies known from mesopotamia 6 180 the narrative then switches to the south the gibeonites trick the israelites into entering an alliance with them by saying that they are not canaanites this prevents the israelites from exterminating them but they are enslaved instead an alliance of amorite kingdoms headed by the canaanite king of jerusalem is defeated with yahweh s miraculous help of stopping the sun and the moon and hurling down large hailstones joshua 1010-14 the enemy kings were eventually hanged on trees the deuteronomist author may have used the then-recent 701bce campaign of the assyrian king sennacherib in the kingdom of judah as his model the hanging of the captured kings is in accordance with assyrian practice of the 8th century bce 7 with the south conquered the narrative moves to the northern campaign a powerful multi-national or more accurately multi-ethnic coalition headed by the king of hazor the most important northern city is defeated with yahwehs help hazor itself is then captured and destroyed chapter 111623 summarises the extent of the conquest joshua has taken the entire land almost entirely through military victories with only the gibeonites agreeing to peaceful terms with israel the land then had rest from war joshua 1123 repeated at 1415 chapter 12 lists the vanquished kings on both sides of the jordan river the two kings who ruled east of the jordan who were defeated under moses leadership joshua 121-6 cf numbers 21 and the 31 kings on the west of the jordan who were defeated under joshuas leadership joshua 127-24 the list of the 31 kings is quasi-tabular the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one etc joshua 1210-11 division of the land chapters 1322 edit having described how the israelites and joshua have carried out the first of their gods commands the narrative now turns to the second to put the people in possession of the land joshua is old advanced or stricken in years by this time joshua 131 this land distribution is a covenantal land grant yahweh as king is issuing each tribe its territory 6 183 the cities of refuge and levitical cities are attached to the end since it is necessary for the tribes to receive their grants before they allocate parts of it to others the transjordanian tribes are dismissed affirming their loyalty to yahweh the book reaffirms moses allocation of land east of the jordan to the tribes of reuben and gad and the half-tribe of manasseh joshua 138-32 cf numbers 321-42 and then describes how joshua divided the newly conquered land of canaan into parcels and assigned them to the tribes by lot 9 joshua 141 also makes reference to the role of eleazar the priest ahead of joshua in the distribution process 10 the description serves a theological function to show how the promise of the land was realized in the biblical narrative its origins are unclear but the descriptions may reflect geographical relations among the places named 11 5 the wording of joshua 181-4 suggests that the tribes of reuben gad judah ephraim and manasseh received their land allocation some time before the remaining seven tribes and a 21-member expedition set out to survey the remainder of the land with a view to organising the allocation to the tribes of simeon benjamin asher naphtali zebulun issachar and dan subsequently 48 cities with their surrounding lands were allocated to the tribe of levi joshua 211-41 cf numbers 357 omitted in the masoretic text but present in the septuagint is a statement that joshua completed the division of the land in its boundaries and the children gave a portion to joshua by the commandment of the lord they gave to him the city for which he asked thamnath sarach gave they him in mount ephraim and joshua built the city and dwelt in it and joshua took the stone knives with which he had circumcised the children of israel which were in the way in the wilderness and he placed them in tamnath sarach 12 by the end of chapter 21 the narrative records that the fulfilment of gods promise of land rest and supremacy over the enemies of the israelites was completejoshua 2143-45 the writer of the letter to the hebrews makes reference to joshua and the promise of rest in hebrews 48 the tribes to whom moses had granted land east of the jordan are authorized to return home to gilead here used in the widest sense for the whole transjordan district 13 having faithfully kept the charge joshua 223 english revised version of supporting the tribes occupying canaan they are granted riches with very much livestock with silver with gold with bronze with iron and with very much clothing as a reward joshua 221-9 joshuas farewell speeches chapters 2324 edit joshua in his old age and conscious that he is going the way of all the earth joshua 2314 gathers the leaders of the israelites together and reminds them of yahwehs great works for them and of the need to love yahweh joshua 2311 the israelites are told just as joshua himself had been told joshua 17 that they must comply with all that is written in the book of the law of moses joshua 236 neither turning aside from it to the right hand or to the left ie by adding to the law or diminishing from it 14 joshua meets again with all the people at shechem in chapter 24 and addresses them a second time he recounts the history of gods formation of the israelite nation beginning with terah the father of abraham and nahor who lived beyond the euphrates river and worshiped other gods joshua 242 he invited the israelites to choose between serving the lord who had delivered them from egypt or the gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the euphrates or the gods of the amorites in whose land they now lived the people chose to serve the lord a decision which joshua recorded in the book of the law of god he then erected a memorial stone under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord in shechem joshua 241-27 the oak is associated with the oak of moreh where abram had set up camp during his travels in this area genesis 126 citation needed thus joshua made a covenant with the people literally cut a covenant a phrase common to the hebrew greek and latin languages it derives from the custom of sacrifice in which the victims were cut in pieces and offered to the deity invoked in ratification of the engagement 15 the people then returned to their inheritance ie their allocated lands joshua 2428 closing items edit the book of joshua closes with three concluding items referred to in the jerusalem bible as two additions 16 the death of joshua and his burial at timnath-serah joshua 2429-31 the burial of the bones of joseph at shechem joshua 2432 the death of eleazar and his burial in land belonging to phinehas in the mountains of ephraim joshua 2433 there were no levitical cities given to the descendants of aaron in ephraim so theologians carl friedrich keil and franz delitzsch suppose the land may have been at geba in the territory of the tribe of benjamin the situation upon the mountains of ephraim is not at variance with this view as these mountains extended according to judges 45 etc far into the territory of benjamin 17 in some manuscripts and editions of the septuagint there is an additional verse relating to the apostasy of the israelites after joshuas death composition edit the book of joshua is an anonymous work the babylonian talmud written in the 3rd to 5th centuries ce was the first attempt to attach authors to the holy books each book according to the authors of the talmud was written by a prophet and each prophet was an eyewitness of the events described and joshua himself wrote the book that bears his name this idea was rejected as untenable by john calvin 15091564 and by the time of thomas hobbes 15881679 it was recognised that the book must have been written much later than the period it depicted 5 2630 there is now general agreement that joshua was composed as part of a larger work the deuteronomistic history stretching from the book of deuteronomy to the books of kings 6 174 in 1943 the german biblical scholar martin noth suggested that this history was composed by a single authoreditor living in the time of the exile 6th century bce 18 317 a major modification to noths theory was made in 1973 by the american scholar frank m cross to the effect that two editions of the history could be distinguished the first and more important from the court of king josiah in the late 7th century bce and the second noths 6th century bce exilic history 5 63 later scholars have detected more authors or editors than either noth or cross allowed for 19 6 historical and archaeological evidence edit see also history of ancient israel and judah the prevailing scholarly view is that joshua is not a factual account of historical events 20 21 4 the apparent setting of joshua is the 13th century bce 21 this was a time of widespread city-destruction but with a few exceptions hazor lachish the destroyed cities are not the ones the bible associates with joshua and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time 22 71-72 given its lack of historicity carolyn pressler in her commentary for the westminster bible companion series suggests that readers of joshua should give priority to its theological message what passages teach about god and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the 7th and 6th centuries bce 23 56 richard nelson explains the needs of the centralised monarchy favoured a single story of origins combining old traditions of an exodus from egypt belief in a national god as divine warrior and explanations for ruined cities social stratification and ethnic groups and contemporary tribes 24 5 in scholarship prior to the early 20th century academic scholarship the historicity of the early israelite campaigns was taken for granted eg paton however by the 1930s martin noth issued what william f albright termed a sweeping criticism of the legitimacy of using biblical data in joshua as material for history 25 noth was a student of albrecht alt who emphasized form criticism and the importance of etiology 25 26 alt and noth posited a peaceful movement of the israelites into various areas of canaan contra the biblical account 27 albright himself questioned the tenacity of etiologies which were key to noths analysis of the campaigns in joshua archaeological evidence in the 1930s showed that the city of ai an early target for conquest in the putative joshua account had existed and been destroyed but in the 22nd century bce 25 in 1951 kathleen kenyon showed that jericho was from the middle bronze age c 21001550 bce not the late bronze age c 15501200 bce kenyon argued that the early israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the israelite settlement 28 29 in 1955 g ernest wright discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early israelite campaigns which he divided into three phases per the book of joshua he pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country ie a period of tremendous violence 30 he gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at hazor by yigael yadin 30 as an alternative to both the military conquest and uncontested infiltration hypotheses george mendenhall and norman gottwald suggested that the israelites emerged through a kind of peasant revolt against their canaanite lords however as explained by gary a rendsburg archaeological findings presented by israel finkelstein in 1986 undermined this idea because the israelites first settled areas were not held by canaanites whose cities were sustained alongside israelite areas 27 mainstream ancient near east scholarship holds that the book of joshua holds little historical value 3 152 the archaeological evidence shows that jericho and ai were not occupied in the near eastern late bronze age 31 the story of the conquest most likely represents the nationalist propaganda of the 8th century bce kings of judah and their claims to the territory of the kingdom of israel 20 incorporated into an early form of joshua written late in the reign of king josiah reigned 640609bce the book was probably revised and completed after the fall of jerusalem to the neo-babylonian empire in 586 bce and possibly after the return from the babylonian exile in 538 bce 4 10-11 themes edit the overarching theological theme of the deuteronomistic history is faithfulness and gods mercy and their opposites faithlessness and gods wrath in the book of judges the books of samuel and the books of kings the israelites become faithless and god ultimately shows his anger by sending his people into exile 32 but in joshua israel is obedient joshua is faithful and god fulfills his promise and gives them the land 23 34 yahwehs war campaign in canaan validates israels entitlement to the land 33 158-159 and provides a paradigm of how israel was to live there twelve tribes with a designated leader united by covenant in warfare and in worship of yahweh alone at a single sanctuary all in obedience to the commands of moses as found in the book of deuteronomy 34 162 god and israel edit the book of joshua takes forward deuteronomys theme of israel as a single people worshipping yahweh in the land god has given them 33 159 yahweh as the main character in the book takes the initiative in conquering the land and yahwehs power wins the battles for example the walls of jericho fall because yahweh fights for israel not because the israelites show superior fighting ability 4 7-8 the potential disunity of israel is a constant theme the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the jordan chapter 2219 even hints that the land across the jordan is unclean and that the tribes who live there have secondary status 4 9 land edit land is the central topic of joshua 21 11 the introduction to deuteronomy recalled how yahweh had given the land to the israelites but then withdrew the gift when israel showed fear and only joshua and caleb had trusted in god 35 33 the land is yahwehs to give or withhold and the fact that he has promised it to israel gives israel an inalienable right to take it for exilic and post-exilic readers the land was both the sign of yahwehs faithfulness and israels unfaithfulness as well as the centre of their ethnic identity in deuteronomistic theology rest meant israels unthreatened possession of the land the achievement of which began with the conquests of joshua 24 1516 the enemy edit joshua carries out a systematic campaign against the civilians of canaan men women and children that amounts to genocide 36 in doing this he is carrying out herem as commanded by yahweh in deuteronomy 2017 you shall not leave alive anything that breathes the purpose is to drive out and dispossess the canaanites with the implication that there are to be no treaties with the enemy no mercy and no intermarriage 6 175 the extermination of the nations glorifies yahweh as a warrior and promotes israels claim to the land while their continued survival explores the themes of disobedience and penalty and looks forward to the story told in judges and kings 24 1819 the divine call for massacre at jericho and elsewhere can be explained in terms of cultural norms israel was not the only iron age state to practice herem and theology a measure to ensure israels purity as well as the fulfillment of gods promise 6 175 but patrick d miller in his commentary on deuteronomy remarks there is no real way to make such reports palatable to the hearts and minds of contemporary readers and believers 35 4041 obedience edit obedience versus disobedience is a constant theme of the work 37 79 obedience ties in the jordan crossing the defeat of jericho and ai circumcision and passover and the public display and reading of the law disobedience appears in the story of achan stoned for violating the herem command the gibeonites and the altar built by the transjordan tribes joshuas two final addresses challenge the israel of the future the readers of the story to obey the most important command of all to worship yahweh and no other gods joshua thus illustrates the central deuteronomistic message that obedience leads to success and disobedience to ruin 24 20 moses joshua and josiah edit the deuteronomistic history draws parallels in proper leadership between moses joshua and josiah 24 102 gods commission to joshua in chapter 1 is framed as a royal installation the peoples pledge of loyalty to joshua as the successor of moses recalls royal practices the covenant-renewal ceremony led by joshua was the prerogative of the kings of judah gods command to joshua to meditate on the book of the law day and night parallels the description of josiah in 2 kings 2325 as a king uniquely concerned with the study of the law the two figures had identical territorial goals josiah died in 609 bce while attempting to annex the former israel to his own kingdom of judah 38 some of the parallels with moses can be seen in the following and not exhaustive list 6 174 joshua sent spies to scout out the land near jericho 21 just as moses sent spies from the wilderness to scout out the promised land num 13 deut 11925 joshua led the israelites out of the wilderness into the promised land crossing the jordan river as if on dry ground 316 just as moses led the israelites out of egypt through the red sea which they crossed as if on dry land ex 1422 after crossing the jordan river the israelites celebrated the passover 51012 just as they did immediately before the exodus exodus 12 joshuas vision of the commander of yahwehs army 51315 is reminiscent of the divine revelation to moses in the burning bush ex 316 joshua successfully intercedes on behalf of the israelites when yahweh is angry for their failure to fully observe the ban herem just as moses frequently persuaded god not to punish the people ex 321114 num 112 141319 joshua and the israelites were able to defeat the people at ai because joshua followed the divine instruction to extend his sword josh 818 just as the people were able to defeat the amalekites as long as moses extended his hand that held the staff of god ex 17813 joshua is old advanced in years 131 at the time when the israelites can begin to settle on the promised land just as moses was old when he died having seen but not entered the promised land deuteronomy 347 joshua served as the mediator of the renewed covenant between yahweh and israel at shechem 83035 24 just as moses was the mediator of yahwehs covenant with the people at mount sinai mount horeb before his death joshua delivered a farewell address to the israelites 2324 just as moses had delivered his farewell address deuteronomy 3233 moses lived to be 120 deuteronomy 347 and joshua lived to be 110 joshua 2429 moral and political interpretations edit with the zionist struggle for a jewish state the early israelite campaigns have undergone renewed attention and interpretation the early zionists according to rachel havrelock read the book of joshua as explaining their times and justifying their wars from this perspective god fought on behalf of manifest israel joshuas vocabulary informed the lexicon of jewish nationalism 39 later in 1958 david ben-gurion saw the biblical war narrative as constituting an ideal basis for a unifying myth of national identity this was a unity that was framed against a common enemy the arabs beyond israels borders 39 ben-gurion met with politicians and scholars such as bible scholar shemaryahu talmon to discuss the conquests in joshua he later published a book of the meeting transcripts in a lecture at ben-gurions home archaeologist yigael yadin argued for the historicity of the israelite military campaign and remarked on how much easier it was for military experts to appreciate the plausibility of the joshua narrative yadin specifically pointed to the conquests of hazor bethel and lachish conversely archaeologist yohanan aharoni argued against the historicity of the early israelite campaigns instead favoring a migration model 39 rachel havrelock herself argues that the myth of conquest although shaped by ardent nationalists with a military agenda could be re-interpreted for the purposes of a decentralized post-nationalism 39 by the same token the biblical narrative of conquest has been used as an apparatus of critique against zionism for example michael prior criticizes the use of the campaign in joshua to favor colonial enterprises in general not only zionism and have been interpreted as validating ethnic cleansing he asserts that the bible was used to make the treatment of palestinians more palatable morally 40 a related moral condemnation can be seen in the political sacralization of imperial genocide contextualizing timothy dwights the conquest of canaan by bill templer 41 this kind of critique is not new jonathan boyarin notes how frederick w turner blamed israels monotheism for the very idea of genocide which boyarin found simplistic yet with precedents 42
