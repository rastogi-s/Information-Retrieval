a b c and d a fifth member of the family physical review e was introduced in 1993 to a large part to accommodate the huge amount of new research in nonlinear dynamics combined these constitute physical review series iii the editorial office moved in 1980 to its present location across the expressway from brookhaven national laboratory goudsmit retired in 1974 and pasternack in the mid-1970s past editors in chief include david lazarus 19801990 university of illinois at urbana-champaign benjamin bederson 19901996 new york university martin blume 19962007 brookhaven national laboratory and

the aps launched physical review fluids to include additional areas of fluid dynamics research 13 and in 2017 it launched physical review materials to fill a gap in the coverage of materials research
