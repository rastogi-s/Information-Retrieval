coronium wikipedia coronium for other uses see coronium gastropod coronium also called newtonium was the name of a suggested chemical element hypothesised in the 19th century the name inspired by the solar corona was given by a gruenwald in 1887 1 a new atomic thin green line in the solar corona was then considered to be emitted a new element unlike anything else seen under laboratory conditions because of this it was also mis-classified as iron line number 1474 2 solar spectroscopy edit during the total solar eclipse of 7 august 1869 a green emission line of wavelength 5303nm was independently observed by charles augustus young 18341908 and william harkness 18371903 in the coronal spectrum since this line did not correspond to that of any known material it was proposed that it was due to an unknown element provisionally named coronium in 1902 in an attempt at a chemical conception of the aether the russian chemist and chemical educator dmitri mendeleev hypothesized that there existed two inert chemical elements of lesser atomic weight than hydrogen of these two he thought the lighter to be an all-penetrating all-pervasive gas and the slightly heavier one to be coronium later he renamed coronium as newtonium 3 it was not until the 1930s that walter grotrian and bengt edln discovered that the spectral line at 5303nm was due to highly ionized iron fe 13 other unusual lines in the coronal spectrum were also caused by highly charged ions such as nickel the high ionization being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona 4
