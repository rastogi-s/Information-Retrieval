list of lunar features wikipedia list of lunar features several features cover the surface of the moon these are listed below valleys edit among many lunar features are several large valleys that have been given names most of these valleys are named after a nearby crater see the list of craters on the moon for more information water features edit this is a list of maria singular mare on the moon lunar maria are the large dark regions of the moon they do not actually contain any water however they are believed to have been formed from molten rock from the moons mantle coming out onto the surface of the moon it also includes the one oceanus and the features known by the names lacus palus and sinus the modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by riccioli 1 ricciolis map of the moon was drawn by francesco maria grimaldi who has a crater named after him 2 maria and oceanus edit there was also a region on the lunar farside that was briefly misidentified as a mare and named mare desiderii sea of dreams it is no longer recognized other former maria include mare parvum 4 small sea immediately to the east of inghirami mare incognitum unknown sea mare novum 4 new sea northeast of plutarch mare struve struves sea near messala lacus edit a related set of features are the lunar lacus singular lacus latin for lake which are smaller basaltic plains of similar origin sinus and paludes edit a related set of features are the sinus singular sinus latin for bay and paludes singular palus latin for marsh some sources also list a palus nebularum marsh of mists at 380 n 10 e however the designation for this feature has not been officially recognized by the iau mountains edit these are isolated mountains or massifs note that the heights listed below are not consistent across sources in the 1960s the us army mapping service used elevation relative to 1737988 meters from the center of the moon in the 1970s the us defense mapping agency used 1730000 meters the clementine topographic data published in the 1990s uses 1737400 meters also note that this table is not comprehensive and does not list the highest places on the moon clementine data show a range of about 18100 meters from lowest to highest point on the moon the highest point located on the far side of the moon is approximately 6500 meters higher than mons huygens usually listed as the tallest mountain mountain ranges edit other features edit the moon s surface is covered in many interesting geological features in addition to mountains valleys and craters the following surface features have received names in the lunar nomenclature many of these features are named after a nearby crater or mountain the listed diameter for these features is the longest dimension that contains the entire geological formation the latitude and longitude are in selenographic coordinates albedo edit these features are notable for their high albedo compared to the surrounding terrain note on the far side of the moon there are unnamed albedo features on mare ingenii and mare marginis these are located antipodal to the mare imbrium and mare orientale impact basins catena edit a catena is a chain of craters dorsa edit these features are wrinkle-ridge systems commonly found on lunar maria dorsum edit these features are wrinkle ridges commonly found on lunar mare promontorium edit these features form a cape or headland on a mare rima edit these features are lunar rilles rimae edit these features are lunar rille systems rupis edit these are escarpments in the surface terra edit the continental areas between the seas were given comparable names by giovanni battista riccioli 8 but were opposite the names used for the seas thus there were the lands of sterility terra sterilitatis heat terra caloris and liveliness terra vitae however these names for the highland regions are no longer used on recent maps and terrae are not officially recognized as standard lunar nomenclature by the international astronomical union 9 craters edit the large majority of these features are impact craters the crater nomenclature is governed by the international astronomical union and this listing only includes features that are officially recognized by that scientific society the lunar craters are listed in the following subsections where a formation has associated satellite craters these are detailed on the main crater description pages
