empire gained their independence many became members of the commonwealth of nations 111 the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test in 1952 but the new post-war limits of britains international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of 1956 the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture 112 113 as a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s the government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries in the following decades the uk became a more

monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example big bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of state-owned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others 120 this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest but ultimately also economic growth particularly in the services sector from 1984 the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues 121 around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland 122 the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily it plays leading roles in the eu un and

of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party and sinn fin northern ireland only note 13 in accordance with party policy no elected sinn fin members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch 175 devolved administrations main articles devolution in the united kingdom list of leaders of devolved administrations northern ireland executive scottish government and welsh government scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uks government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so-called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively 176 on matters that affect only england 177 the 2013 mckay commission on this recommended that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament 178 the scottish government and parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government 179 in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 55.3 to 44.7 180 the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland 181 the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly 182 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north-south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the britishirish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non-operation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly 183 184 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions 185 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions 186 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland 187 law and criminal justice main article law of the united kingdom the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotlands separate legal system 188 today the uk has three distinct systems of law english law northern ireland law and scots law a new supreme court of the

court is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies 191 both english law which applies in england and wales and northern ireland law are based on common-law principles 192 the essence of common law is that subject to statute the law is developed by judges in courts applying statute precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis 193 the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions 194 scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases 195 and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases 196 the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law 197 sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or with a sheriff and no jury known as sheriff summary court 198 the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial guilty not guilty and not proven both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal 199 crime in england and wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015 200 according to crime statistics the prison population of england and wales has increased to 86000 giving england and wales the highest rate of incarceration in western europe at 148 per 100000 201 202 her majestys prison service which reports to the ministry of justice manages most of the prisons within england and wales the murder rate in england and wales has stabilised in the first half of the 2010s with a murder rate around 1 per 100000 which is half the peak in 2002 and similar to the rate in the 1980s 203 204 crime in scotland fell slightly in 20142015 to its lowest level in 39 years in with 59 killings for a murder rate of 1.1 per 100000 scotlands prisons are

substantial immigration from africa the caribbean and south asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the british empire 334 migration from new eu member states in central and eastern europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups although some of this migration has been temporary 335 since the 1990s there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population with migrants to the uk coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries 336 337 338
