cassinihuygens wikipedia cassinihuygens the cassinihuygens mission k s i n i h n z k see nee hoy gnz commonly called cassini was a collaboration between nasa the european space agency esa and the italian space agency asi to send a probe to study the planet saturn and its system including its rings and natural satellites the flagship class robotic spacecraft comprised both nasas cassini probe and esas huygens lander which landed on saturns largest moon titan 7 cassini was the fourth space probe to visit saturn and the first to enter its orbit the craft were named after astronomers giovanni cassini and christiaan huygens launched aboard a titan ivbcentaur on october 15 1997 cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years with 13 years spent orbiting saturn studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on july 1 2004 8 the voyage to saturn included flybys of venus april 1998 and july 1999 earth august 1999 the asteroid 2685 masursky and jupiter december 2000 its mission ended on september 15 2017 when cassinis trajectory took it into saturns upper atmosphere and it burned up 9 10 in order to prevent any risk of contaminating saturns moons which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft 11 12 the mission is widely perceived to have been successful beyond expectation cassini-huygens has been described by nasas planetary science division director as a mission of firsts 13 that has revolutionized human understanding of the saturn system including its moons and rings and our understanding of where life might be found in the solar system cassini s original mission was planned to last for four years from june 2004 to may 2008 the mission was extended for another two years until september 2010 branded the cassini equinox mission the mission was extended a second and final time with the cassini solstice mission lasting another seven years until september 15 2017 on which date cassini was de-orbited to burn up in saturns upper atmosphere the huygens module traveled with cassini until its separation from the probe on december 25 2004 it was landed by parachute on titan on january 14 2005 it returned data to earth for around 90 minutes using the orbiter as a relay this was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer solar system and the first landing on a moon other than our own at the end of its mission the cassini spacecraft executed the grand finale of its mission a number of risky passes through the gaps between saturn and saturns inner rings 4 5 the purpose of this phase was to maximize cassini s scientific outcome before the spacecraft was disposed 14 the atmospheric entry of cassini ended the mission but analyses of the returned data will continue for many years overview edit teams from 28 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing building flying and collecting data from the cassini orbiter and huygens probe the mission was managed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory in the united states where the orbiter was assembled huygens was developed by the european space research and technology centre the centres prime contractor arospatiale of france now thales alenia space assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many european countries huygens batteries and two scientific instruments by the united states the italian space agency asi provided the cassini orbiters high-gain radio antenna with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna to ensure telecommunications with the earth for the entire duration of the mission a compact and lightweight radar which also uses the high-gain antenna and serves as a synthetic-aperture radar a radar altimeter a radiometer the radio science subsystem rss the visible channel portion vims-v of vims spectrometer 15 the vims infrared counterpart was provided by nasa as well as main electronic assembly which includes electronic subassemblies provided by cnes of france 16 17 on april 16 2008 nasa announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission at which point it was renamed the cassini equinox mission 18 the round of funding was again extended in february 2010 with the cassini solstice mission naming edit the mission consisted of two main elements the asinasa cassini orbiter named for the italian astronomer giovanni domenico cassini discoverer of saturns ring divisions and four of its satellites and the esa-developed huygens probe named for the dutch astronomer mathematician and physicist christiaan huygens discoverer of titan the mission was commonly called saturn orbiter titan probe sotp during gestation both as a mariner mark ii mission and generically cassini-huygens was a flagship-class mission to the outer planets 7 the other planetary flagships include galileo voyager and viking 7 objectives edit cassini had several objectives including 19 determining the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the rings of saturn determining the composition of the satellite surfaces and the geological history of each object determining the nature and origin of the dark material on iapetus s leading hemisphere measuring the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the magnetosphere studying the dynamic behavior of saturns atmosphere at cloud level studying the time variability of titans clouds and hazes characterizing titans surface on a regional scale cassinihuygens was launched on october 15 1997 from cape canaveral air force station s space launch complex40 using a usair force titan iv b centaur rocket the complete launcher was made up of a two-stage titan iv booster rocket two strap-on solid rocket motors the centaur upper stage and a payload enclosure or fairing 20 the total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about us326 billion including 14billion for pre-launch development 704 million for mission operations 54million for tracking and 422million for the launch vehicle the united states contributed 26billion 80 the esa 500million 15 and the asi 160million 5 21 however these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in october 2000 they do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission nor do they include the cost of the extended missions the primary mission for cassini was completed on july 30 2008 the mission was extended to june 2010 cassini equinox mission 22 this studied the saturn system in detail during the planets equinox which happened in august 2009 18 on february 3 2010 nasa announced another extension for cassini lasting 6 1 2 years until 2017 ending at the time of summer solstice in saturns northern hemisphere cassini solstice mission the extension enabled another 155revolutions around the planet 54flybys of titan and 11flybys of enceladus 23 in 2017 an encounter with titan changed its orbit in such a way that at closest approach to saturn it was only 3000km above the planets cloudtops below the inner edge of the d ring this sequence of proximal orbits ended when its final encounter with titan sent the probe into saturns atmosphere to be destroyed itinerary edit history edit cassinihuygens s origins date to 1982 when the european science foundation and the american national academy of sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions two european scientists suggested a paired saturn orbiter and titan probe as a possible joint mission in 1983 nasas solar system exploration committee recommended the same orbiter and probe pair as a core nasa project nasa and the european space agency esa performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985 esa continued with its own study in 1986 while the american astronaut sally ride in her influential 1987 report nasa leadership and americas future in space also examined and approved of the cassini mission citation needed while rides report described the saturn orbiter and probe as a nasa solo mission in 1988 the associate administrator for space science and applications of nasa len fisk returned to the idea of a joint nasa and esa mission he wrote to his counterpart at esa roger bonnet strongly suggesting that esa choose the cassini mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that nasa would commit to the mission as soon as esa did citation needed at the time nasa was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the american and european space programs as a result of european perceptions that nasa had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations nasa officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning cassinihuygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission in part this newfound spirit of cooperation with europe was driven by a sense of competition with the soviet union which had begun to cooperate more closely with europe as esa drew further away from nasa late in 1988 esa chose cassinihuygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the us 24 25 the collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped cassinihuygens survive congressional budget cuts in the united states cassinihuygens came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994 but nasa successfully persuaded the us congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after esa had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations the project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994 although citizens groups concerned about its potential environmental impact attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch 26 27 28 29 30 spacecraft design edit the spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized rtg powered mariner mark ii a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of mars cassini was developed simultaneously with the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft but budget cuts and project rescopings forced nasa to terminate craf development to save cassini as a result cassini became more specialized the mariner markii series was cancelled including the orbiter and probe it has been the second-largest unmanned interplanetary spacecraft built 31 32 as well as being among the most complex 31 the orbiter had a mass of 2150kg 4740lb the probe 350kg 770lb with the launch vehicle adapter and 3132kg 6905lb of propellants at launch the spacecraft had a mass of 5600kg 12300lb only the two phobos 1 and 2 spacecraft sent to mars by the soviet union were larger the cassini spacecraft was 6.8 meters 22ft high and 4 meters 13ft wide spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory flight path to saturn and by the ambitious science at its destination cassini had 1630 interconnected electronic components 22000 wire connections and 14 kilometers 87mi of cabling citation needed the core control computer cpu was a redundant mil-std-1750a system the main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup r-4d bipropellant rocket engine the thrust of each engine was 490 newtons and the total spacecraft delta-v was about 2040 meters per second 33 smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control cassini was powered by 327kg 34 of plutonium-238 the heat from the materials radioactive decay was turned into electricity huygens was supported by cassini during cruise but used chemical batteries when independent the probe contained a dvd with more than 616400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries collected in a public campaign 35 36 until september 2017 the cassini probe continued orbiting saturn at a distance of between 8.2 and 10.2 astronomical units from the earth it took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from earth to the spacecraft and vice versa thus ground controllers could not give real-time instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events even if response were immediate more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers response by the satellite instruments edit summary edit instruments 38 optical remote sensing located on the remote

june 2011 due to an electrical short circuit that occurred in the instrument the instrument was powered on in march 2012 after 78 days a second short circuit forced the instrument to be again shut down 41 cosmic dust analyzer cda the cda is a direct sensing instrument that measures the size speed and direction of tiny dust grains near saturn it can also measure the grains chemical elements 42 some of these particles are orbiting saturn while others may come from other star systems the cda on the orbiter is designed to learn more about these particles the materials in other celestial bodies and potentially about the origins of the universe 39 composite infrared spectrometer cirs the cirs is a remote sensing instrument that measures the infrared radiation coming from objects to learn about their temperatures thermal properties and compositions throughout the cassinihuygens mission the cirs measured infrared emissions from atmospheres rings and surfaces in the vast saturn system it

cameras allow for many data collection modes including on-chip data compression both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheelto view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 11m 39 45 dual technique magnetometer mag the mag is a direct sensing instrument that measures the strength and direction of the magnetic field around saturn the magnetic fields are generated partly by the molten core at saturns center measuring the magnetic field is one of the ways to probe the core mag aimed to develop a three-dimensional model of saturns magnetosphere and determine the magnetic state of titan and its atmosphere and the icy satellites and their role in the magnetosphere of saturn 39 46 magnetospheric imaging instrument mimi the mimi is both a direct and remote sensing instrument that produces images and other data about the particles trapped in saturns huge magnetic field or magnetosphere this information was used to study the overall configuration and dynamics of the magnetosphere and its interactions with the solar wind saturns atmosphere titan rings and icy satellites 39 47 mimi includes the ion and neutral camera inca which captures and measures energetic neutral atoms enas 48 radar the on-board radar is an active and passive sensing instrument that has produced maps of titans surface the active radar can send radar waves able to penetrate the thick veil of haze surrounding titan by measuring the send and return time of the signals it is possible to determine the height of large surface features such as

its rings to learn more about their structure and composition designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition distribution aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres unlike other types of spectrometer this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings it is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across the spectral dimension is 1024 pixels per spatial pixel also it

used to measure visible light the other infrared vims measures reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100nm to help determine their compositions temperatures and structures it also observes the sunlight and starlight that passes through the rings to learn more about their structure scientists used vims for long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the saturn system to determine saturns weather patterns 39 plutonium power source edit because of saturns distance from the sun solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe 49 to generate enough power such arrays would have been too large and too heavy 49 instead the cassini orbiter was powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs which use heat from the natural decay of about 33kg 73lb of plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium dioxide to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics 49 the rtgs on the cassini mission have the same design as those used on the new horizons galileo and ulysses space probes and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes 49 at the end of the nominal 11-year cassini mission they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power 49 one of the spare rtgs for the cassini mission was used to power the new horizons mission to pluto and the kuiper belt which was designed and launched later citation needed to gain momentum while already in flight the trajectory of the cassini mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers two fly-by passes of venus one more of the earth and then one of the planet jupiter the terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings the maneuver was successful with cassini passing by 1171km 728mi above the earth on august 18 1999 50 had there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the earth nasas complete environmental impact study estimated that in the worst case with an acute angle of entry in which cassini would gradually burn up a significant fraction of the 33kg 34 of plutonium-238 inside the rtgs would have been dispersed into the earths atmosphere so that up to five billion people ie almost the entire terrestrial population could have been exposed causing up to an estimated 5000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades 51 0.0005 per cent ie a fraction 0.000005 of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere 52 as 500000 deaths however the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million 51 telemetry edit the cassini spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats the telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem because without it there could be no data return the telemetry was developed from ground up due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions 53 therefore cassini was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the telemetry dictionary and the software development process led to the creation of a telemetry manager for the mission there were around 1088 channels in 67 mini-packets assembled in the cassini telemetry dictionary out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and kalman gain elements 161 measurements not used during normal mission operations this left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets a total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 aacs telemetry modes were constructed these modes are 1 record 2 nominal cruise 3 medium slow cruise 4 slow cruise 5 orbital ops 6 av 7 ate attitude estimator calibration these 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes huygens probe edit main article huygens spacecraft huygens view of titans surface same image with different data processing the huygens probe supplied by the european space agency esa and named after the 17thcentury dutch astronomer who first discovered titan christiaan huygens scrutinized the clouds atmosphere and surface of saturns moon titan in its descent on january 15 2005 it was designed to enter and brake in titans atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface 54 the probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to titan and the probe support equipment pse which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft the pse includes electronics that track the probe recover the data gathered during its descent and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to earth the core control computer cpu was a redundant mil-std-1750a control system the data were transmitted by a radio link between huygens and cassini provided by probe data relay subsystem pdrs as the probes mission could not be telecommanded from earth because of the great distance it was automatically managed by the command data management subsystem cdms the pdrs and cdms were provided by the italian space agency asi after cassini s launch it was discovered that data sent back from the probe to european space agencys mission control center was largely unreadable it was determined that cassini s receiver was unable to accurately process the changes in frequency and wavelength of the signal it would be receiving from huygens during its descent to titan 14 the problem was rectified by changing the distance and angle of cassini s trajectory to huygens during the landing 14 55 selected events and discoveries edit main article cassinihuygens timeline venus and earth fly-bys and the cruise to jupiter edit the cassini space probe performed two gravitational-assist flybys of venus on april 26 1998 and june 24 1999 these flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt at that point the suns gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner solar system on august 18 1999 at 0328utc the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the earth one hour and 20minutes before closest approach cassini made its closest approach to the earths moon at 377000 kilometers and it took a series of calibration photos on january 23 2000 cassini performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 masursky at around 1000 utc it took photos 56 in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of 16million kilometers and a diameter of 15 to 20km was estimated for the asteroid jupiter flyby edit cassini made its closest approach to jupiter on december 30 2000 and made many scientific measurements about 26000 images of jupiter its faint rings and its moons were taken during the six month flyby it produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet see image at right in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60km 37mi across 57 a major finding of the flyby announced on march 6 2003 was of jupiters atmospheric circulation dark belts alternate with light zones in the atmosphere and scientists had long considered the zones with their pale clouds to be areas of upwelling air partly because many clouds on earth form where air is rising but analysis of cassini imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds too small to see from earth pop up almost without exception in the dark belts according to anthony del genio of nasas goddard institute for space studies the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on jupiter so the net motion in the zones has to be sinking other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze about the size of the great red spot near jupiters north pole infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles with bands of globe-encircling winds with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions the same announcement also discussed the nature of jupiters rings light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped rather than spherical and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on jupiters moons probably metis and adrastea tests of general relativity edit on october 10 2003 the missions science team announced the results of tests of albert einstein s general theory of relativity performed by using radio waves transmitted from the cassini space probe 58 the radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft as those passed close to the sun according to the general theory of relativity a massive object like the sun causes space-time to curve causing a beam of radiowaves or light or any form of electromagnetic radiation that passes by the sun to travel farther known as the shapiro time delay although some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models no such deviations were found by this experiment previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the viking and voyager space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand the more refined measurements from the cassini space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51000 59 the data firmly support einsteins general theory of relativity citation needed new moons of saturn edit in total the cassini mission discovered seven new moons orbiting saturn 60 using images taken by cassini researchers discovered methone pallene and polydeuces in 2004 61 although later analysis revealed that voyager 2 had photographed pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet 62 on may 1 2005 a new moon was discovered by cassini in the keeler gap it was given the designation s2005s1 before being named daphnis a fifth new moon was discovered by cassini on may 30 2007 and was provisionally labeled s2007 s 4 it is now known as anthe a press release on february 3 2009 showed a sixth new moon found by cassini the moon is approximately 13 of a mile 500m in diameter within the g-ring of the ring system of saturn and is now named aegaeon formerly s2008 s 1 63 a press release on november 2 2009 mentions the seventh new moon found by cassini on july 26 2009 it is presently labeled s2009 s 1 and is approximately 300m 1000ft in diameter in the b-ring system 64 on april 14 2014 nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in the a ring of the planet saturn 65 phoebe flyby edit on june 11 2004 cassini flew by the moon phoebe this was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images it also was cassinis only possible flyby for phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around saturn 66 the first close-up images were received on june 12 2004 and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface saturn rotation edit in an announcement on june 28 2004 cassini program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of saturn 67 because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period the repetition of radio emissions was used this new data agreed with the latest values measured from earth and constituted a puzzle to the scientists it turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by voyager 1 and it was now 6 minutes longer this however does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet but is thought to be due to movement of the source of the radio emissions to a different latitude at which the rotation rate is different orbiting saturn edit on july 1 2004 the spacecraft flew through the gap between the f and g rings and achieved orbit after a seven-year voyage 68 it was the first spacecraft to ever orbit saturn the saturn orbital insertion soi maneuver performed by cassini was complex requiring the craft to orient its high-gain antenna away from earth and along its flight path to shield its instruments from particles in saturns rings once the craft crossed the ring plane it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622 meterss to allow saturn to capture it 69 cassini was captured by saturns gravity at around 854pm pacific daylight time on june 30 2004 during the maneuver cassini passed within 20000km 12000mi of saturns cloud tops when cassini was in saturnian orbit departure from the saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning 70 clarification needed titan flybys edit cassini had its first flyby of saturns largest moon titan on july 2 2004 a day after orbit insertion when it approached to within 339000km 211000mi of titan images taken through special filters able to see through the moons global haze showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness on october 27 2004 the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of titan when it passed a mere 1200 kilometers above the moon almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to earth including the first radar images of the moons haze-enshrouded surface it revealed the surface of titan at least the area covered by radar to be relatively level with topography reaching no more than about 50 meters in altitude the flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent titan flybys cassini collected pictures of titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of earth huygens lands on titan edit main article huygens spacecraft cassini released the huygens probe on december 25 2004 by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability it entered the atmosphere of titan on january 14 2005 and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground 5 although cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from huygens of its descent and landing site a software error failed to turn on one of the cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures while landing for caution nasa loaded huygens with 3 parachutes 71 enceladus flybys edit during the first two close flybys of the moon enceladus in 2005 cassini discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent cassini also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of enceladus which gives more credibility to the idea that enceladus is supplying the particles of saturns e ring mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions 72 on march 12 2008 cassini made a close fly-by of enceladus passing within 50km of the moons surface 73 the spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers detecting water carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer 74 cassini was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction on november 21 2009 cassini made its eighth flyby of enceladus 75 this time with a different geometry approaching within 1600 kilometers 990mi of the surface the composite infrared spectrograph cirs instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the baghdad sulcus tiger stripe the data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moons saturn-facing hemisphere on april 3 2014 nearly ten years after cassini entered saturns orbit nasa reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in enceladus the presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moons rocky core places enceladus among the most likely places in the solar system to host alien microbial life 76 77 78 on june 30 2014 nasa celebrated ten years of cassini exploring saturn and its moons highlighting the discovery of water activity on enceladus among other findings 79 in september 2015 nasa announced that gravitational and imaging data from cassini were used to analyze the librations of enceladus orbit and determined that the moons surface is not rigidly joined to its core concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent 80 on october 28 2015 cassini performed a close flyby of enceladus coming within 49km 30mi of the surface and passing through the icy plume above the south pole 81 radio occultations of saturns rings edit in may 2005 cassini began a series of radio occultation experiments to measure the size-distribution of particles in saturns rings and measure the atmosphere of saturn itself for over four months the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose during these experiments it flew behind the ring plane of saturn as seen from earth and transmitted radio waves through the particles the radio signals received on earth were analyzed for frequency phase and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings upper image visible color mosaic of saturns rings taken on december 12 2004 lower image simulated view constructed from a radio occultation observation on may 3 2005 color in the lower image represents ring particle sizes spokes in rings verified edit in images captured september 5 2005 cassini detected spokes in saturns rings 82 previously seen only by the visual observer stephen james omeara in 1977 and then confirmed by the voyager space probes in the early 1980s 83 84 full citation needed lakes of titan edit main article lakes of titan radar images obtained on july 21 2006 appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon such as methane and ethane in titans northern latitudes this is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on earth the lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across 85 on march 13 2007 the jet propulsion laboratory announced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of titan at least one of these is larger than any of the great lakes in north america 86 saturn hurricane edit in november 2006 scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of saturn with a distinct eyewall this is characteristic of a hurricane on earth and had never been seen on another planet before unlike a terrestrial hurricane the storm appears to be stationary at the pole the storm is 8000 kilometers 5000mi across and 70 kilometers 43mi high with winds blowing at 560 kilometers per hour 350mph 87 iapetus flyby edit on september 10 2007 cassini completed its flyby of the strange two-toned walnut-shaped moon iapetus images were taken from 1000 miles 1600km above the surface as it was sending the images back to earth it was hit by a cosmic ray that forced it to temporarily enter safe mode all of the data from the flyby were recovered 88 mission extension edit on april 15 2008 cassini received funding for a 27-month extended mission it consisted of 60 more orbits of saturn with 21 more close titan flybys seven of enceladus six of mimas eight of tethys and one targeted flyby each of dione rhea and helene 89 the extended mission began on july 1 2008 and was renamed the cassini equinox mission as the mission coincided with saturns equinox 90 second mission extension edit a proposal was submitted to nasa for a second mission extension september 2010 may 2017 provisionally named the extended-extended mission or xxm 91 this 60m pa was approved in february 2010 and renamed the cassini solstice mission 92 it included cassini orbiting saturn 155 more times conducting 54 additional flybys of titan and 11 more of enceladus great storm of 2010 and aftermath edit on october 25 2012 cassini witnessed the aftermath of the massive great white spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on saturn 93 data from the composite infrared spectrometer cirs instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of saturn 83k 83c 149f above normal simultaneously a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by nasa researchers at goddard research center in greenbelt maryland ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on earth the storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on december 5 2010 in saturns northern hemisphere the storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths allowing scientists to observe the temperature of saturns atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye the spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for saturn scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the solar system initially being larger than jupiters great red spot venus transit edit on december 21 2012 cassini observed a transit of venus across the sun 94 the vims instrument analyzed sunlight passing though the venusian atmosphere 94 vims previously observed the transit of exoplanet hd 189733 b 94 the day the earth smiled edit main article the day the earth smiled on july 19 2013 the probe was pointed towards earth to capture an image of the earth and the moon as part of a natural light multi-image portrait of the entire saturn system the event was unique as it was the first time nasa informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance 95 96 the imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies with cassini scientist carolyn porco describing the moment as a chance to celebrate life on the pale blue dot 97 rhea flyby edit on february 10 2015 the cassini spacecraft visited rhea more closely coming within 47000km 29000mi 98 the spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of rhea 99 hyperion flyby edit cassini performed its latest flyby of saturns moon hyperion on may 31 2015 at a distance of about 34000km 21000mi 100 hyperion context view from 37000km 23000mi may 31 2015 hyperion close-up view from 38000km 24000mi may 31 2015 dione flyby edit cassini performed its last flyby of saturns moon dione on august 17 2015 at a distance of about 475km 295mi a previous flyby was performed on june 16 101 hexagon changes color edit main article saturns hexagon between 2012 and 2016 the persistent hexagonal cloud pattern at saturns north pole changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color 102 one theory for this is a seasonal change extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the sun 102 it was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on saturn between 2004 and 2008 103 grand finale and destruction edit main article cassini retirement cassini s end involved a series of close saturn passes approaching within the rings then an entry into saturns atmosphere on september 15 2017 to destroy the spacecraft 5 10 70 this method was chosen because it is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of saturn thought to offer potential habitability 104 in 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal each with varying funding scientific and technical challenges 105 a short period saturn impact for an end of mission was rated excellent with the reasons d-ring option satisfies unachieved ao goals cheap and easily achievable while collision with an icy moon was rated good for being cheap and achievable anywheretime 105 on november 29 2016 the spacecraft performed a titan flyby that took it to the gateway of f-ring orbits this was the start of the grand finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet 106 107 a final titan flyby on april 22 2017 changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between saturn and its inner ring days later on april 26 cassini passed about 3100km 1900mi above saturns cloud layer and 320km 200mi from the visible edge of the inner ring it successfully took images of saturns atmosphere and began returning data the next day 108 after a further 22 orbits through the gap the mission was ended with a dive into saturns atmosphere on september 15 signal was lost at 75546 am edt on september 15 2017 just 30 seconds later than predicted it is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission cassini impact site on saturn visual ir mapping spectrometer september 15 2017 a close-up image of saturns atmosphere from about 3100km 1900mi above the cloud layer taken by cassini on its first dive on april 26 2017 at the start of the grand finale last image color taken by cassini as it descended toward saturn the image was taken 634000km 394000 miles above saturn on september 14 2017 at 1959 utc 109 last image bw taken by the imaging cameras on the cassini spacecraft september 14 2017 at 1959 utc play media video 0340 detailing cassini s grand finale mission and a look back at what the mission has accomplished missions edit the spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions 110 each is structured according to a certain amount of funding goals etc 110 at least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on the cassinihuygens mission in addition thousands of people overall worked to design manufacture and launch the mission 111 prime mission july 2004 through june 2008 112 113 cassini equinox mission was a two-year mission extension which ran from july 2008 through september 2010 110 cassini solstice mission ran from october 2010 through april 2017 110 114 also known as the xxm mission 103 grand finale spacecraft directed into saturn april 2017 to september 15 2017 114 farewell to saturn and moons enceladus epimetheus janus
