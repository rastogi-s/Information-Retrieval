einstein observatory wikipedia einstein observatory this article is about the x-ray telescope for the observatory building in potsdam see einstein tower for the proposed gravitational wave detector see einstein telescope einstein observatory heao-2 was the first fully imaging x-ray telescope put into space and the second of nasa s three high energy astrophysical observatories named heao b before launch the observatorys name was changed to honor albert einstein upon its successfully attaining orbit 1 launch edit the einstein observatory heao-2 was launched on november 13 1978 from cape canaveral florida on an atlas-centaur slv-3d booster rocket into a near-circular orbit with an initial altitude slightly above 500km its orbital inclination orbit was 23.5 degrees the einstein observatory satellite re-entered the earths atmosphere and burned up on march 25 1982 2 instrumentation edit the einstein observatory carried a single large grazing-incidence focusing x-ray telescope that provided unprecedented levels of sensitivity hundreds of times better than previously achieved and arc-second angular resolution of point sources and extended objects it had instruments sensitive in the 0.2 to 3.5 kev energy range a collection of four focal-plane instruments was installed in the satellite 3 hri or high resolution imaging camera 015-3 kev ipc or imaging proportional counter 0.4 to 4 kev sss or solid state spectrometer 0.5 to 4.5 kev fpcs or bragg focal plane crystal spectrometer there was also a coaxial instrument mpc the monitor proportional counter working in the 1-20 kev range and two filters that could be used with the imaging detectors bbfs broad band filter spectrometer aluminium and beryllium filters than can be placed into the x-ray beam to change the spectral sensitivity ogs objective grating spectrometer transmission gratings with a spectral resolution of about 50
