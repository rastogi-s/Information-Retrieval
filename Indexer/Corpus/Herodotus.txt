herodotus wikipedia herodotus herodotus h r d t s ancient greek hrdotos attic greek pronunciation hrdotos was a greek historian who was born in halicarnassus in the persian empire modern-day bodrum turkey and lived in the fifth centurybc c 484c 425bc a contemporary of thucydides socrates and euripides he is often referred to as the father of history a title first conferred by cicero 1 he was the first historian known to have broken from homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically by collecting his materials systematically and critically and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative 2 the histories is the only work which he is known to have produced a record of his inquiry histora on the origins of the greco-persian wars it primarily deals with the lives of croesus cyrus cambyses smerdis darius and xerxes and the battles of marathon thermopylae artemisium salamis plataea and mycale however its many cultural ethnographical geographical historiographical and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the histories and contain a wealth of information some of his stories are fanciful and others inaccurate yet he states that he is reporting only what he was told a sizable portion of the information he provided was later confirmed by historians and archaeologists despite herodotuss historical significance little is known of his personal life place in history edit herodotus announced the size and scope of his work at the beginning of his researches or histories here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by herodotus of halicarnassus the purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both greeks and non-greeks among the matters covered is in particular the cause of the hostilities between greeks and non-greeks herodotus the histories robin waterfield translation 2008 predecessors edit his record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself though the extent of it has been debated herodotuss place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked his work is the earliest greek prose to have survived intact however dionysius of halicarnassus a literary critic of augustan rome listed seven predecessors of herodotus describing their works as simple unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people greek or foreign including popular legends sometimes melodramatic and nave often charming all traits that can be found in the work of herodotus himself 3 modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain but according to the ancient account these predecessors included dionysius of miletus charon of lampsacus hellanicus of lesbos xanthus of lydia and the best attested of them all hecataeus of miletus of these only fragments of hecataeuss works survived and the authenticity of these is debatable 4 but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which herodotus wrote his own histories writing style edit in his introduction to hecataeuss work genealogies hecataeus the milesian speaks thus i write these things as they seem true to me for the stories told by the greeks are various and in my opinion absurd this points forward to the folksy yet international outlook typical of herodotus however one modern scholar has described the work of hecataeus as a curious false start to history 5 since despite his critical spirit he failed to liberate history from myth herodotus mentions hecataeus in his histories on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and on another occasion quoting athenian complaints against his handling of their national history 6 it is possible that herodotus borrowed much material from hecataeus as stated by porphyry in a quote recorded by eusebius 7 in particular it is possible that he copied descriptions of the crocodile hippopotamus and phoenix from hecataeuss circumnavigation of the known world periegesis periodos ges even misrepresenting the source as heliopolitans histories 2.73 8 but hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory unlike herodotus nor did he include the oral traditions of greek history within the larger framework of oriental history 9 there is no proof that herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict from any predecessor despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times 5 10 herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism for example he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with europe and asiaafrica equal in size histories 4.36 and 4.42 however he retains idealizing tendencies as in his symmetrical notions of the danube and nile 11 his debt to previous authors of prose histories might be questionable but there is no doubt that herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers for example athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces upset by the hubris of kings and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure his familiarity with athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing aeschylus s persae including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the persian navy at salamis caused the defeat of the land army histories 8.68 persae 728 the debt may have been repaid by sophocles because there appear to be echoes of the histories in his plays especially a passage in antigone that resembles herodotuss account of the death of intaphernes histories 3.119 antigone 904-920 12 however this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship 13 homer was another inspirational source a just as homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry sung by wandering minstrels so herodotus appears to have drawn on an ionian tradition of story-telling collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels these oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography anthropology and history all compiled by herodotus in an entertaining style and format 15 contemporary and modern critics edit it is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics in early modern times branded him the father of lies 16 17 even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement in fact one modern scholar 18 has wondered if herodotus left his home in greek anatolia migrating westwards to athens and beyond because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places thuria herodotus the son of sphynx lies in ionic history without peer a dorian born who fled from slanders brand and made in thuria his new native land 19 yet it was in athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found in 425bc which is about the time that herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died the athenian comic dramatist aristophanes created the acharnians in which he blames the peloponnesian war on the abduction of some prostitutes a mocking reference to herodotus who reported the persians account of their wars with greece beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines io europa medea and helen 20 21 similarly the athenian historian thucydides dismissed herodotus as a logos-writer story-teller 22 thucydides who had been trained in rhetoric became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material whereas with his frequent digressions herodotus appeared to minimize or possibly disguise his authorial control 23 moreover thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the greek world-view focused on the context of the polis or city-state the interplay of civilizations was more relevant to greeks living in anatolia such as herodotus himself for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent memory 22 before the persian crisis history had been represented among the greeks only by local or family traditions the wars of liberation had given to herodotus the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a greek these wars showed him that there was a corporate life higher than that of the city of which the story might be told and they offered to him as a subject the drama of the collision between east and west with him the spirit of history was born into greece and his work called after the nine muses was indeed the first utterance of clio richard claverhouse jebb 24 life edit modern scholars generally turn to herodotuss own writing for reliable information about his life 25 supplemented with ancient yet much later sources such as the byzantine suda an 11thcentury encyclopaedia which possibly took its information from traditional accounts the data are so few they rest upon such late and slight authority they are so improbable or so contradictory that to compile them into a biography is like building a house of cards which the first breath of criticism will blow to the ground still certain points may be approximately fixed george rawlinson 26 childhood edit modern accounts of his life typically 27 28 go something like this herodotus was born at halicarnassus around 484bc there is no reason to disbelieve the suda s information about his family that it was influential and that he was the son of lyxes and dryo and the brother of theodorus and that he was also related to panyassis an epic poet of the time the town was within the persian empire at that time making herodotus a persian subject 29 30 and it may be that the young herodotus heard local eye-witness accounts of events within the empire and of persian preparations for the invasion of greece including the movements of the local fleet under the command of artemisia i of caria inscriptions recently discovered at halicarnassus indicate that her grandson lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure his name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the athenian delian league indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454bc the epic poet panyassis a relative of herodotus is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising herodotus expresses affection for the island of samos iii3960 and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth so it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against lygdamis leading to a period of exile on samos and followed by some personal hand in the tyrants eventual fall herodotus wrote his histories in the ionian dialect yet he was born in halicarnassus which was a dorian settlement according to the suda herodotus learned the ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of samos to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of lygdamis tyrant of halicarnassus and grandson of artemisia the suda also informs us that herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at halicarnassus dated to about herodotuss time we now know that the ionic dialect was used in halicarnassus in some official documents so there is no need to assume like the suda that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere 31 further the suda is the only source which we have for the role played by herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace that itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account 32 early travels edit as herodotus himself reveals halicarnassus though a dorian city had ended its close relations with its dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel i144 and it had helped pioneer greek trade with egypt ii178 it was therefore an outward-looking international-minded port within the persian empire and the historians family could well have had contacts in other countries under persian rule facilitating his travels and his researches herodotuss eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in egypt in association with athenians probably some time after 454bc or possibly earlier after an athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against persian rule in 460454bc he probably traveled to tyre next and then down the euphrates to babylon for some reason possibly associated with local politics he subsequently found himself unpopular in halicarnassus and some time around 447bc migrated to periclean athens a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires v78 athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography vi137 viii525 as well as leading citizens such as the alcmaeonids a clan whose history features frequently in his writing according to eusebius 33 and plutarch 34 herodotus was granted a financial reward by the athenian assembly in recognition of his work it is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for athenian citizenship a rare honour after 451bc requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly later life edit in 443bc or shortly afterwards he migrated to thurium as part of an athenian-sponsored colony aristotle refers to a version of the histories written by herodotus of thurium and some passages in the histories have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern italy from personal experience there iv1599 vi127 intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the peloponnesian war vi91 vii133 233 ix73 indicate that he might have returned to athens in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague possibly he died in macedonia instead after obtaining the patronage of the court there or else he died back in thurium there is nothing in the histories that can be dated to later than 430bc with any certainty and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards possibly before his sixtieth year author and orator edit herodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd john marincola writes in his introduction to the penguin edition of the histories that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of herodotuss work which could be labeled as performance pieces these portions of the research seem independent and almost detachable so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance the intellectual matrix of the 5thcentury marincola suggests comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work the idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience 35 it was conventional in herodotuss day for authors to publish their works by reciting them at popular festivals according to lucian herodotus took his finished work straight from anatolia to the olympic games and read the entire histories to the assembled spectators in one sitting receiving rapturous applause at the end of it 36 according to a very different account by an ancient grammarian 37 herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade by which time the assembly had dispersed hence the proverbial expression herodotus and his shade to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay herodotuss recitation at olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the suda that of photius 38 and tzetzes 39 in which a young thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father and burst into tears during the recital herodotus observed prophetically to the boys father your sons soul yearns for knowledge eventually thucydides and herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in thucydides tomb in athens such at least was the opinion of marcellinus in his life of thucydides 40 according to the suda he was buried in macedonian pella and in the agora in thurium 41 reliability edit the histories were occasionally criticized in antiquity b but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view 42 despite the controversy 43 c herodotus still serves as the primary and often only source for events in the greek world persian empire and the region generally in the two centuries leading up until his own day 16 45 herodotus like many ancient historians preferred an element of show d to purely analytic history aiming to give pleasure with exciting events great dramas bizarre exotica 47 as such certain passages 48 49 have been the subject of controversy and even some doubt both in antiquity and today 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 e the accuracy of the works of herodotus has been controversial since his own era f cicero g 58 aristotle josephus duris of samos h 59 harpocration i 60 and plutarch all commented on this controversy 61 62 generally however he was regarded as reliable in antiquity and is especially so today many scholars ancient and modern routinely cite herodotus eg aubin a h l heeren davidson cheikh anta diop poe welsby celenko volney pierre montet bernal jackson dubois strabo many of these scholars welsby heeren aubin diop etc explicitly mention the reliability of herodotuss work j and demonstrate corroboration of herodotuss writings by modern scholars k 63 ahl heeren quoted herodotus throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages source of the nile location of meroe etc 64 to further his work on the egyptians and assyrians aubin uses herodotuss accounts in various passages and defends herodotuss position aubin said that herodotus was the author of the first important narrative history of the world 65 diop provides several examples the inundations of the nile which he argues support his view that herodotus was quite scrupulous objective scientific for his time diop argues that herodotus always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told diop also notes that strabo corroborated herodotuss ideas about the black egyptians ethiopians and colchians 66 67 egypt edit the reliability of herodotus writing about egypt is sometimes criticized 56 l alan b lloyd argues that as a historical document the writings of herodotus are seriously defective and that he was working from inadequate sources 50 nielsen writes though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of herodotus having been in egypt it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it 51 german historian detlev fehling questions whether herodotus ever traveled up the nile river and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about egypt and ethiopia 68 52 fehling states that there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story about the claim of herodotus that pharaoh sesostris campaigned in europe and that he left a colony in colchia 54 53 m science edit herodotus provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime often engaging in private speculation for example he reports that the annual flooding of the nile was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in africa the hottest part of the known world offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the sun over this part of the world 218ff he also passes on reports from phoenician sailors that while circumnavigating africa they saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards owing to this brief mention which is included almost as an afterthought it has been argued that africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been his accounts of india are among the oldest records of indian civilization by an outsider 69 70 discoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to herodotuss credibility he described gelonus located in scythia as a city thousands of times larger than troy this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975 the archaeological study of the now-submerged ancient egyptian city of heracleion and the recovery of the so-called naucratis stela give credibility to herodotuss previously unsupported claim that heracleion was founded during the egyptian new kingdom after journeys to india and pakistan french ethnologist michel peissel claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in herodotuss histories 71 in book 3 passages 102 to 105 herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized furry ants lives in one of the far eastern indian provinces of the persian empire this region he reports is a sandy desert and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust these giant ants according to herodotus would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust peissel reports that in an isolated region of northern pakistan on the deosai plateau in gilgitbaltistan province there is a species of marmot the himalayan marmot a type of burrowing squirrel that may have been what herodotus called giant ants the ground of the deosai plateau is rich in gold dust much like the province that herodotus describes according to peissel he interviewed the minaro tribal people who live in the deosai plateau and they have confirmed that they have for generations been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows later authors such as pliny the elder mentioned this story in the gold mining section of his naturalis historia peissel offers the theory that herodotus may have confused the old persian word for marmot with the word for mountain ant research suggests that herodotus probably did not know any persian or any other language except his native greek and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual persian empire herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described 71 72 herodotus did though follow up in passage 105 of book 3 with the claim that the ants are said to chase and devour full-grown camels accusations of bias edit some calumnious fictions were written about herodotus in a work titled on the malice of herodotus by plutarch a chaeronean by birth or it might have been a pseudo-plutarch in this case a great collector of slanders including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school 73 similarly in a corinthian oration dio chrysostom or yet another pseudonymous author accused the historian of prejudice against corinth sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments 74 an account also given by marcellinus in his life of thucydides 75 in fact herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities such as aristocrats and priests and this also occurred at an international level with periclean athens becoming his principal source of information about events in greece as a result his reports about greek events are often coloured by athenian bias against rival states thebes and corinth in particular 76 the histories were sometimes criticized in antiquity n but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of herodotuss methodology especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing a few modern scholars have argued that herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources 77 yet his reputation continues largely intact herodotus is variously considered father of comparative anthropology 16 the father of ethnography 45 and more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history 42 herodotuss use of sources and sense of authority edit it is clear from the beginning of book 1 of the histories that herodotus utilizes or at least claims to utilize various sources in his narrative kh waters relates that herodotos did not work from a purely hellenic standpoint he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive plutarch of being philobarbaros a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner 78 herodotus will at times relate various accounts of the same story for example in book 1 he mentions both the phoenician and the persian accounts of io 79 however herodotus will at time arbitrate between varying accounts i am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other rather i will point out the man who i know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the greeks 80 again later herodotus claims himself as an authority i know this is how it happened because i heard it from the delphians myself 81 throughout his work herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people speaking about solon the athenian herodotus states solon sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down 82 again in the story about croesus and his sons death when speaking of adrastus the man who accidentally killed croesus son herodotus states adrastus believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known cut his own throat over the grave 83 while herodotus had not met these people whom he is discussing he claims to understand their thoughts and intentions mode of explanation edit herodotus writes with the purpose of explaining that is he discusses the reason for or cause of for an event he lays this out in the proem this is the publication of the research of herodotus of halicarnassus so that the actions of people shall not fade with time so that the great and admirable achievements of both greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned and among other things to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other 84 this mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to homer 85 who opened the iliad by asking which of the immortals set these two at each others throats apollo zeus son and letos offended by the warlord agamemnon had dishonored chryses apollos priest so the god struck the greek camp with plague and the soldiers were dying of it 86 both homer and herodotus begin with a question of causality in homers case who set these two at each others throats in herodotuss case why did the greeks and barbarians go to war with each other herodotuss means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause rather his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions it is notable however that the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for herodotus just as they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself 87 some readers of herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons as understood by his contemporaries rather than providing more abstract reasons 88 types of causality edit herodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents these are not perceived as mutually exclusive but rather mutually interconnected this is true of greek thinking in general at least from homer onward 89 gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question why did this happen but rather why did this happen to me by way of example faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing however divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when i am inside it was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling 90 some authors including geoffrey de ste croix and mabel lang have argued that fate or the belief that this is how it had to be is herodotuss ultimate understanding of causality 91 herodotuss explanation that an event was going to happen maps well on to aristotelean and homeric means of expression the idea of it was going to happen reveals a tragic discovery associated with fifth-century drama this tragic discovery can be seen in homers iliad as well 92 john gould argues that herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a philosophy of history or simple causality thus according to gould herodotuss means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior 93 herodotus sense of what was going to happen is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories the narrative impulse itself the impulse towards closure and the sense of an ending is retrojected to become explanation 94 herodotus and myth edit although herodotus considered his inquiries a serious pursuit of knowledge he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth but he did so judiciously with regard for his historical method by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability 95 while the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events herodotus states emphatically that many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man ix 100 in book one passages 23 and 24 herodotus relates the story of arion the renowned harp player second to no man living at that time who was saved by a dolphin herodotus prefaces the story by noting that a very wonderful thing is said to have happened and alleges its veracity by adding that the corinthians and the lesbians agree in their account of the matter having become very rich while at the court of periander arion conceived a desire to sail to italy and sicily he hired a vessel crewed by corinthians whom he felt he could trust but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth arion discovered the plot and begged for his life but the crew gave him two options that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea arion flung himself into the water and a dolphin carried him to shore 96 herodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians john herrington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing herodotuss dynamic position in the history of western art and thought herodotus as centaur the human forepart of the animal is the urbane and responsible classical historian the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains out of an older freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force 97 herodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales he is both while herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study thus to understand what herodotus is doing in the histories we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian or between the work as myth and the work as history as james romm has written herodotus worked under a common ancient greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold eg in myths or legends produces a valid kind of understanding even when this retelling is not entirely factual 98 for herodotus then it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding
