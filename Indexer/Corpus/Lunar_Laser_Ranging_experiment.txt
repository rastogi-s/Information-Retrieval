lunar laser ranging experiment wikipedia lunar laser ranging experiment the ongoing lunar laser ranging experiment measures the distance between earth and the moon using laser ranging lasers on earth are aimed at retroreflectors planted on the moon during the apollo program 11 14 and 15 and the two lunokhod missions 1 the time for the reflected light to return is measured the first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the massachusetts institute of technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the moons surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length 2 similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a soviet team at the crimean astrophysical observatory using a q-switched ruby laser 3 greater accuracy was achieved following the installation of a retroreflector array on july 21 1969 by the crew of apollo 11 and two more retroreflector arrays left by the apollo 14 and apollo 15 missions have also contributed to the experiment successful lunar laser range measurements to the retroreflectors were first reported by the 31m telescope at lick observatory air force cambridge research laboratories lunar ranging observatory in arizona the pic du midi observatory in france the tokyo astronomical observatory and mcdonald observatory in texas the unmanned soviet lunokhod 1 and lunokhod 2 rovers carried smaller arrays reflected signals were initially received from lunokhod 1 but no return signals were detected after 1971 until a team from university of california rediscovered the array in april 2010 using images from nasa s lunar reconnaissance orbiter 4 lunokhod 2s array continues to return signals to earth 5 the lunokhod arrays suffer from decreased performance in direct sunlighta factor considered in reflector placement during the apollo missions 6 the apollo 15 array is three times the size of the arrays left by the two earlier apollo missions its size made it the target of three-quarters of the sample measurements taken in the first 25 years of the experiment improvements in technology since then have resulted in greater use of the smaller arrays by sites such as the cte dazur observatory in grasse france and the apache point observatory lunar laser-ranging operation apollo at the apache point observatory in new mexico details edit the distance to the moon is calculated approximately using this equation distance speed of light time taken for light to reflect 2 in actuality the round-trip time of about 2.5 seconds is affected by the location of the moon in the sky the relative motion of earth and the moon earths rotation lunar libration weather polar motion propagation delay through earths atmosphere the motion of the observing station due to crustal motion and tides velocity of light in various parts of air and relativistic effects 7 nonetheless the earthmoon distance has been measured with increasing accuracy for more than 35 years the distance continually changes for a number of reasons but averages 3850006km 2392283mi 8 at the moons surface the beam is about 6.5 kilometers 40mi wide 9 and scientists liken the task of aiming the beam to using a rifle to hit a moving dime 3 kilometers 19mi away the reflected light is too weak to see with the human eye out of 10 17 photons aimed at the reflector only one is received back on earth every few seconds even under good conditions they can be identified as originating from the laser because the laser is highly monochromatic this is one of the most precise distance measurements ever made and is equivalent in accuracy to determining the distance between los angeles and new york to 025mm 00098in 6 10 as of 2002 update work is progressing on increasing the accuracy of the earthmoon measurements to near millimeter accuracy though the performance of the reflectors continues to degrade with age 6 results edit lunar laser ranging measurement data is available from the paris observatory lunar analysis center 11 and the active stations some of the findings of this long-term experiment are the moon is spiraling away from earth at a rate of 38cm per year 9 this rate has been described as anomalously high 12 the moon probably has a liquid core of about 20 of the moons radius 5 the universal force of gravity is very stable the experiments have constrained the change in newtons gravitational constant g to a factor of 2710 13 per year 13 the likelihood of any nordtvedt effect a differential acceleration of the moon and earth towards the sun caused by their different degrees of compactness has been ruled out to high precision 14 15 strongly supporting the validity of the strong equivalence principle einsteins theory of gravity the general theory of relativity predicts the moons orbit to within the accuracy of the laser ranging measurements 5 gauge freedom plays a major role in a correct physical interpretation of the relativistic effects in the earth-moon system observed with llr technique 16
