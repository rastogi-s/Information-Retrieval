x-ray telescope wikipedia x-ray telescope an x-ray telescope xrt is a telescope that is designed to observe remote objects in the x-ray spectrum in order to get above the earths atmosphere which is opaque to x-rays x-ray telescopes must be mounted on high altitude rockets balloons or artificial satellites the basic elements of the telescope are the optics focusing or collimating that collects the radiation entering the telescope and the detector on which the radiation is collected and measured a variety of different designs and technologies have been used for these elements many of the existing telescopes on satellites are compounded of multiple copies or variations of a detector-telescope system whose capabilities add or complement each other and additional fixed or removable elements 1 2 filters spectrometers that add functionalities to the instrument optics edit main article x-ray optics the most common methods used in x-ray optics are grazing incidence mirrors and collimated apertures focusing mirrors edit the utilization of x-ray mirrors allows to focus the incident radiation on the detector plane different geometries eg kirkpartick-baez or lobster-eye have been suggested or employed but almost the totality of existing telescopes employs some variation of the wolter i design the limitations of this type of x-ray optics result in much narrower fields of view typically 1 degree than visible or uv telescopes with respect to collimated optics focusing optics allow a high resolution imaging a high telescope sensitivity since radiation is focused on a small area signal-to-noise ratio is much higher for this kind of instruments the mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil 3 coated with a thin layer of a reflective material typically gold or iridium mirrors based on this construction work on the basis of total reflection of light at grazing incidence this technology is limited in energy range by the inverse relation between critical angle for total reflection and radiation energy the limit in the early 2000s with chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observatories was about 15 kilo electronvolt kev light 4 using new multi-layered coated mirrors the x-ray mirror for the nustar telescope pushed this up to 79 kev light 4 to reflect at this level glass layers were multi-coated with tungsten w silicon si or platinum pt silicon carbide sic 4 collimating optics edit main article coded aperture while earlier x-ray telescopes were using simple collimating techniques eg rotating collimators wire collimators 5 the technology most currently used on present days employs coded aperture masks this technique uses a flat aperture patterned grille in front of the detector this design results less sensitive than focusing optics and imaging quality and identification of source position is much poorer however it offers a larger field of view and can be employed at higher energies where grazing incidence optics become ineffective also the imaging is not direct but the image is rather reconstructed by post-processing of the signal detectors edit main article x-ray astronomy detector several technologies have been employed on detectors for x-ray telescopes ranging from counters like ionization chambers geiger counters or scintillators to imaging detectors like ccds or cmos sensors the use of micro-calorimeters that offer the added capability of measuring with great accuracy the energy of the radiation is planned for future missions missions employing x-ray telescopes edit main article list of x-ray space telescopes exosat edit
