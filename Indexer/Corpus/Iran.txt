until 224ce when it was succeeded by the sasanian empire 81 together with their neighboring arch-rival the roman byzantines they made up the worlds two most dominant powers at the time for over four centuries 21 22 the sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the achaemenids with their capital at ctesiphon late-antiquity sasanian empire is considered one of the most influential periods of iran as their influence reached the culture of ancient rome and through that as far as western europe 82 83 africa 84 china and india 85 and played a prominent role in the formation of the medieval art of both europe and asia 86 most of the era of the sasanian empire was overshadowed by the romanpersian wars which raged on the western borders at anatolia the western caucasus mesopotamia and the levant for over 700 years these wars exhausted both the romans and the sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the muslim invasion throughout the achaemenid parthian and sasanian eras several offshoots of the iranian dynasties established eponymous branches in anatolia and the caucasus including the pontic kingdom the mihranids and the arsacid dynasties of armenia

wars most importantly the climactic war of 602628 as well as the social conflict within the sasanian empire opened the way for an arab invasion of iran in the seventh century 87 88 the empire was initially defeated by the rashidun caliphate which was succeeded by the umayyad caliphate followed by the abbasid caliphate meanwhile the prolonged and gradual process of islamization was followed which targeted irans then zoroastrian majority and included religious persecution 89 90 91 demolition of libraries 92 and fire temples 93 a special tax penalty jizya 94 95 and language shift 96 97 in 750 the abbasids overthrew the umayyads notably by the support from the mawali converted iranians 98 the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army which was led by converted iranian general abu muslim 99 100 101 the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a relative revival of iranian culture and influence as the role of the old arab aristocracy was partially replaced by a muslim iranian bureaucracy 102 after two centuries of arab rule semi-independent and independent iranian kingdomsincluding the tahirids saffarids samanids and buyids began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate by the samanid era in the ninth and 10th centuries the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified 103 the blossoming literature philosophy medicine and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization during a period known as the islamic golden age 107 108 the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries during which iran was the main theater of scientific activities 109 after the 10th century persian alongside arabic was used for scientific medical philosophical historical and musical works and renowned iranian writerssuch as tusi avicenna qotb-od-din shirazi and biruni had major contributions in scientific writing the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity thus the attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran the shuubiyya movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders 110 the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the works of epic poet ferdowsi now considered the most prominent figure in iranian literature the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau 111 turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks slave-warriors replacing iranian and arab elements within the army 99 as a result the mamluks gained a significant political power in 999 large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids whose rulers were of mamluk turkic origin and longer subsequently under the seljuk and khwarezmian empires these dynasties had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership 111 the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them 112 113 the result of the adoption and patronage of iranian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition from 1219 to 1221 under the khwarezmian empire iran suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan according to steven r ward mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that irans population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th century 114 following the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256 hulagu khan grandson of genghis khan established the ilkhanate in iran in 1370 yet another conqueror timur followed the example of hulagu establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years in 1387 timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan reportedly killing 70000 citizens 115 the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians surrounding themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian 116 early modern period main articles safavid dynasty afsharid dynasty zand dynasty and qajar dynasty by the 1500s ismail i of ardabil established the safavid empire with his capital at tabriz 111 beginning with azerbaijan he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of greater iran 117 iran was predominantly sunni 118 but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam 119 spreading throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus iran anatolia and mesopotamia as a result thereof modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan having there the first and the second highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world 120 121 meanwhile the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire led to numerous ottomaniranian wars 114 the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas i 15871629 114 122 surpassing their turkish archrivals in strength and making iran a leading science and art hub in western eurasia the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s which was caused by internal conflicts the continuous wars with the ottomans and the foreign interference most notably the russian interference the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated sultan husayn in 1722 in 1729 nader shah a chieftain and military genius from khorasan successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran during the reign of nader shah iran reached its greatest extent since the sasanian empire reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus as well as other major parts of the west and central asia and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time 24 nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s his territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus against then revolting lezgins the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750 bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity 114 compared to its preceding dynasties the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto independence and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates however despite the self-ruling they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king 123 the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west 124 another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 out of which agha mohammad khan emerged founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 in 1795 following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians the qajars captured tbilisi by the battle of krtsanisi and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus reestablishing the iranian suzerainty over the region from the 1800s to the 1940s main articles russo-iranian wars iranian

series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by qajar monarchs naser-ed-din and mozaffar-ed-din and led to the constitutional revolution in 1905 the first iranian constitution and the first national parliament of iran were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution the constitution included the official recognition of irans three religious minorities namely christians jews and zoroastrians 138 which has remained a basis in the legislation of iran since then the struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the triumph of tehran in 1909 when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate on the pretext of restoring order the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come but this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by mirza kuchik khan s jungle movement against both the qajar monarchy and foreign invaders during world war i the british occupied much of the territory of western iran and fully withdrew in 1921 meanwhile a famine in northern iran killed between eight and 10 million people the persian campaign commenced furthermore in

141 142 143 apart from the rule of agha mohammad khan the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule 111 the iranian cossack brigade which was the most effective military force available to the crown began a military coup supported by the british in february 1921 the qajar dynasty was subsequently overthrown and reza khan the former general of the cossack brigade became the new prime

anglo-soviet invasion of iran reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi 145 146 subsequently iran became a major conduit for british and american aid to the soviet union until the end of the ongoing war 147 at the 1943 tehran conference the allied big three joseph stalin franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill issued the tehran declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of iran however at the end of the war soviet troops remained in iran and local pro-soviet groups established two puppet states in north-western iran namely the

inflation by 1974 the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation and despite the many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste by 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s by the late 1970s many of these people opposed the shahs regime and began to organize and join the protests against it 152 the 1979 revolution later known as the islamic revolution 153 154

joined with islamists to overthrow the shah tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards 160 many former ministers and officials in the shahs government including former prime minister
