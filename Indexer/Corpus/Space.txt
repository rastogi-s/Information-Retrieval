space wikipedia space this article is about the general framework of distance and direction for the space beyond earths atmosphere see outer space for the keyboard key see space bar for other uses see spacedisambiguation space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction 1 physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions although modern physicists usually consider it with time to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime the concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe however disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity a relationship between entities or part of a conceptual framework debates concerning the nature essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity namely to treatises like the timaeus of plato or socrates in his reflections on what the greeks called khra ie space or in the physics of aristotle book iv delta in the definition of topos ie place or in the later geometrical conception of place as space qua extension in the discourse on place qawl fi al-makan of the 11th-century arab polymath alhazen 2 many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century particularly during the early development of classical mechanics in isaac newton s view space was absolutein the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space 3 other natural philosophers notably gottfried leibniz thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects given by their distance and direction from one another in the 18th century the philosopher and theologian george berkeley attempted to refute the visibility of spatial depth in his essay towards a new theory of vision later the metaphysician immanuel kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside worldthey are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences kant referred to the experience of space in his critique of pure reason as being a subjective pure a priori form of intuition in the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-euclidean in which space is conceived as curved rather than flat according to albert einstein s theory of general relativity space around gravitational fields deviates from euclidean space 4 experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space philosophy of space leibniz and newton in the seventeenth century the philosophy of space and time emerged as a central issue in epistemology and metaphysics at its heart gottfried leibniz the german philosopher-mathematician and isaac newton the english physicist-mathematician set out two opposing theories of what space is rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world space is that which results from places taken together 5 unoccupied regions are those that could have objects in them and thus spatial relations with other places for leibniz then space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete 6 space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members although people in the family are related to one another the relations do not exist independently of the people 7 leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe but since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then according to the identity of indiscernibles there would be no real difference between them according to the principle of sufficient reason any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong 8 newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation for a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion in which the object travels with constant velocity and non-inertial motion in which the velocity changes with time since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions but newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces it must be absolute 9 he used the example of water in a spinning bucket to demonstrate his argument water in a bucket is hung from a rope and set to spin starts with a flat surface after a while as the bucket continues to spin the surface of the water becomes concave if the buckets spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin the concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water 10 instead newton argued it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself for several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter kant in the eighteenth century the german philosopher immanuel kant developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be both a priori and synthetic 11 according to kant knowledge about space is synthetic in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement in his work kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience 12 non-euclidean geometry main article non-euclidean geometry euclids elements contained five postulates that form the basis for euclidean geometry one of these the parallel postulate has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries it states that on any plane on which there is a straight line l 1 and a point p not on l 1 there is exactly one straight line l 2 on the plane that passes through the point p and is parallel to the straight line l 1 until the 19th century few doubted the truth of the postulate instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms 13 around 1830 though the hungarian jnos bolyai and the russian nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate called hyperbolic geometry in this geometry an infinite number of parallel lines pass through the point p consequently the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180 and the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter is greater than pi in the 1850s bernhard riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry in which no parallel lines pass through p in this geometry triangles have more than 180 and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than pi gauss and poincar although there was a prevailing kantian consensus at the time once non-euclidean geometries had been formalised some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved carl friedrich gauss a german mathematician was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space he thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle and there are reports that he actually carried out a test on a small scale by triangulating mountain tops in germany 14 henri poincar a french mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment 15 he considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties known as a sphere-world in this world the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere with a suitable falloff in temperature if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane rather than a spherical surface 16 in fact the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and poincar argued the same is true for the debate over whether real space is euclidean or not for him which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of convention 17 since euclidean geometry is simpler than non-euclidean geometry he assumed the former would always be used to describe the true geometry of the world 18 einstein in 1905 albert einstein published his special theory of relativity which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as spacetime in this theory the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observerswhich has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another moreover an observer will measure a moving clock to tick more slowly than one that is stationary with respect to them and objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer subsequently einstein worked on a general theory of relativity which is a theory of how gravity interacts with spacetime instead of viewing gravity as a force field acting in spacetime einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself 19 according to the general theory time goes more slowly at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field scientists have studied the behaviour of binary pulsars confirming the predictions of einsteins theories and non-euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime mathematics main article three-dimensional space not to be confused with space mathematics in modern mathematics spaces are defined as sets with some added structure they are frequently described as different types of manifolds which are spaces that locally approximate to euclidean space and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold there are however many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces for example vector spaces such as function spaces may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from euclidean space and topological spaces replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness physics many of the laws of physics such as the various inverse square laws depend on dimension three 20 in physics our three-dimensional space is viewed as embedded in four-dimensional spacetime called minkowski space see special relativity the idea behind space-time is that time is hyperbolic-orthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions classical mechanics main article classical mechanics space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present on the other hand it can be related to other fundamental quantities thus similar to other fundamental quantities like time and mass space can be explored via measurement and experiment relativity main article theory of relativity before einstein s work on relativistic physics time and space were viewed as independent dimensions einsteins discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object spacetime it turns out that distances in space or in time separately are not invariant with respect to lorentz coordinate transformations but distances in minkowski space-time along space-time intervals arewhich justifies the name in addition time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in minkowski space-time one can freely move in space but not in time thus time and space coordinates are treated differently both in special relativity where time is sometimes considered an imaginary coordinate and in general relativity where different signs are assigned to time and space components of spacetime metric furthermore in einsteins general theory of relativity it is postulated that space-time is geometrically distorted curved near to gravitationally significant masses 21 one consequence of this postulate which follows from the equations of general relativity is the prediction of moving ripples of space-time called gravitational waves while indirect evidence for these waves has been found in the motions of the hulsetaylor binary system for example experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the ligo and virgo collaborations ligo scientists reported the first such direct observation of gravitational waves on 14 september 2015 22 23 cosmology main article shape of the universe relativity theory leads to the cosmological question of what shape the universe is and where space came from it appears that space was created in the big bang 13.8 billion years ago 24 and has been expanding ever since the overall shape of space is not known but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the cosmic inflation spatial measurement main article measurement the measurement of physical space has long been important although earlier societies had developed measuring systems the international system of units si is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space and is almost universally used currently the standard space interval called a standard meter or simply meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of exactly 1299792458 of a second this definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the special theory of relativity in which the speed of light plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature geographical space see also spatial analysis geography is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing the earth utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations cartography is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device geostatistics apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena geographical space is often considered as land and can have a relation to ownership usage in which space is seen as property or territory while some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership while still other cultures such as australian aboriginals rather than asserting ownership rights to land invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land spatial planning is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level with decisions made at regional national and international levels space can also impact on human and cultural behavior being an important factor in architecture where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures and on farming ownership of space is not restricted to land ownership of airspace and of waters is decided internationally other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spacesfor example to the radio bands of the electromagnetic spectrum or to cyberspace public space is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community and managed in their name by delegated bodies such spaces are open to all while private property is the land culturally owned by an individual or company for their own use and pleasure abstract space is a term used in geography to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity when modeling activity or behavior it is a conceptual tool used to limit extraneous variables such as terrain in psychology psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of psychology psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an objects physical appearance or its interactions are perceived see for example visual space other more specialized topics studied include amodal perception and object permanence the perception of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival especially with regards to hunting and self preservation as well as simply ones idea of personal space several space-related phobias have been identified including agoraphobia the fear of open spaces astrophobia the fear of celestial space and claustrophobia the fear of enclosed spaces the understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using unconscious inference and is closely related to hand-eye coordination the visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called depth perception
