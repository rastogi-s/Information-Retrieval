cyclotron wikipedia cyclotron for other uses see cyclotron disambiguation a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by ernest o lawrence 1 2 in 1934 in which charged particles accelerate outwards from the centre along a spiral path 3 4 the particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying radio frequency electric field lawrence was awarded the 1939 nobel prize in physics for this invention 4 cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine the largest single-magnet cyclotron was the 467m 184in synchrocyclotron built between 1940 and 1946 by lawrence at the university of california at berkeley 4 which could accelerate protons to 730 mev the largest cyclotron is the 171m 56ft multimagnet triumf accelerator at the university of british columbia in vancouver british columbia which can produce 500mev protons over 1200 cyclotrons are used in nuclear medicine worldwide for the production of radionuclides 5 history edit the cyclotron was conceived in germany in the 1920s at aachen university in 1926 the cyclotron was proposed by a co-student of rolf wider who rejected the idea as too complicated to construct 6 7 in 1927 max steenbeck developed the concept of the cyclotron at siemens but a misunderstanding prevented him from publishing and building the apparatus 8 9 10 the first cyclotron patent was filed by hungarian physicist leo szilard in 1929 while working at humboldt university of berlin 11 12 13 14 the first cyclotron was developed and patented 2 by ernest lawrence in 1932 at the university of california berkeley 15 he used large electromagnets recycled from obsolete poulsen arc radio transmitters provided by the federal telegraph company 16 a graduate student m stanley livingston did much of the work of translating the idea into working hardware 17 lawrence read an article about the concept of a drift tube linac by rolf widere 18 19 who had also been working along similar lines with the betatron concept at the radiation laboratory of the university of california at berkeley lawrence constructed a series of cyclotrons which were the most powerful accelerators in the world at the time a 69cm 27in 48mev machine 1932 a 94cm 37in 8mev machine 1937 and a 152cm 60in 16mev machine 1939 he also developed a 467cm 184in synchrocyclotron 1945 lawrence received the 1939 nobel prize in physics for this work the first european cyclotron was constructed in leningrad in the physics department of the radium institute headed by vitaly khlopin ru this leningrad instrument was first proposed in 1932 by george gamow and lev mysovskii ru and was installed and became operative by 1937 20 21 22 in nazi germany a cyclotron was built in heidelberg under supervision of walther bothe and wolfgang gentner with support from the heereswaffenamt and became operative in 1943 principle of operation edit diagram showing how a cyclotron works the magnets pole pieces are shown smaller than in reality they must actually be as wide as the dees to create a uniform field a cyclotron accelerates a charged particle beam using a high frequency alternating voltage which is applied between two hollow d-shaped sheet metal electrodes called dees inside a vacuum chamber 23 the dees are placed face to face with a narrow gap between them creating a cylindrical space within them for the particles to move the particles are injected into the center of this space the dees are located between the poles of a large electromagnet which applies a static magnetic field b perpendicular to the electrode plane the magnetic field causes the particles path to bend in a circle due to the lorentz force perpendicular to their direction of motion if the particles speeds were constant they would travel in a circular path within the dees under the influence of the magnetic field however a radio frequency rf alternating voltage of several thousand volts is applied between the dees the frequency is set so that the particles make one circuit during a single cycle of the voltage to achieve this the frequency must match the particles cyclotron resonance frequency where b is the magnetic field strength q is the electric charge of the particle and m is the relativistic mass of the charged particle each time after the particles pass to the other dee electrode the polarity of the rf voltage reverses therefore each time the particles cross the gap from one dee electrode to the other the electric field is in the correct direction to accelerate them the particles increasing speed due to these pushes causes them to move in a larger radius circle with each rotation so the particles move in a spiral path outward from the center to the rim of the dees when they reach the rim a small voltage on a metal plate deflects the beam so it exits the dees through a small gap between them and hits a target located at the exit point at the rim of the chamber or leaves the cyclotron through an evacuated beam tube to hit a remote target various materials may be used for the target and the nuclear reactions due to the collisions will create secondary particles which may be guided outside of the cyclotron and into instruments for analysis the cyclotron was the first cyclical accelerator the advantage of the cyclotron design over the existing electrostatic accelerators of the time such as the cockcroft-walton accelerator and van de graaff generator was that in these machines the particles were only accelerated once by the voltage so the particles energy was equal to the accelerating voltage on the machine which was limited by air breakdown to a few million volts in the cyclotron in contrast the particles encounter the accelerating voltage many times during their spiral path and so are accelerated many times 2 so the output energy can be many times the accelerating voltage particle energy edit since the particles are accelerated by the voltage many times the final energy of the particles is not dependent on the accelerating voltage but on the strength of the magnetic field and the diameter of the accelerating chamber the dees cyclotrons can only accelerate particles to speeds much slower than the speed of light nonrelativistic speeds for nonrelativistic particles the centripetal force required to keep them in their curved path is where is the particles mass its velocity and is the radius of the path this force is provided by the lorentz force of the magnetic field where is the particles charge the particles reach their maximum energy at the periphery of the dees where the radius of their path is the radius of the dees equating these two forces so the output energy of the particles is therefore the limit to the cyclotrons output energy for a given type of particle is the strength of the magnetic field which is limited to about 2 t for ferromagnetic electromagnets and the radius of the dees which is determined by the diameter of the magnets pole pieces so very large magnets were constructed for cyclotrons culminating in lawrences 1946 synchrocyclotron which had pole pieces 467m 184in 15.3 feet in diameter relativistic considerations edit in the nonrelativistic approximation the frequency does not depend upon the radius of the particles orbit since the particles mass is constant as the beam spirals out its frequency does not decrease and it must continue to accelerate as it is travelling a greater distance in the same time period in contrast to this approximation as particles approach the speed of light their relativistic mass increases requiring either modifications to the frequency leading to the synchrocyclotron or modifications to the magnetic field during the acceleration which leads to the isochronous cyclotron the relativistic mass can be rewritten as where is the particle rest mass is the relative velocity and is the lorentz factor the relativistic cyclotron frequency and angular frequency can be rewritten as and where would be the cyclotron frequency in classical approximation would be the cyclotron angular frequency in classical approximation the gyroradius for a particle moving in a static magnetic field is then given by because where v would be the linear velocity synchrocyclotron edit main article synchrocyclotron a synchrocyclotron is a cyclotron in which the frequency of the driving rf electric field is varied to compensate for relativistic effects as the particles velocity begins to approach the speed of light this is in contrast to the classical cyclotron where the frequency was held constant thus leading to the synchrocyclotron operation frequency being where is the classical cyclotron frequency and again is the relative velocity of the particle beam the rest mass of an electron is 511kevc 2 so the frequency correction is 1 for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 511kv direct current accelerating voltage the proton mass is nearly two thousand times the electron mass so the 1 correction energy is about 9mev which is sufficient to induce nuclear reactions isochronous cyclotron edit an alternative to the synchrocyclotron is the isochronous cyclotron which has a magnetic field that increases with radius rather than with time isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory for this reason an isochronous cyclotron is also called an avf azimuthal varying field cyclotron 24 this solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by l h thomas in 1938 24 recalling the relativistic gyroradius and the relativistic cyclotron frequency one can choose to be proportional to the lorentz factor this results in the relation which again only depends on the velocity like in the non-relativistic case also the cyclotron frequency is constant in this case the transverse de-focusing effect of this radial field gradient is compensated by ridges on the magnet faces which vary the field azimuthally as well this allows particles to be accelerated continuously on every period of the radio frequency rf rather than in bursts as in most other accelerator types this principle that alternating field gradients have a net focusing effect is called strong focusing it was obscurely known theoretically long before it was put into practice 25 examples of isochronous cyclotrons abound in fact almost all modern cyclotrons use azimuthally-varying fields the triumf cyclotron mentioned below is the largest with an outer orbit radius of 79metres extracting protons at up to 510mev which is 34 of the speed of light the psi cyclotron reaches higher energy but is smaller because of using a higher magnetic field usage edit for several decades cyclotrons were the best source of high-energy beams for nuclear physics experiments several cyclotrons are still in use for this type of research the results enable the calculation of various properties such as the mean spacing between atoms and the creation of various collision products subsequent chemical and particle analysis of the target material may give insight into nuclear transmutation of the elements used in the target cyclotrons can be used in particle therapy to treat cancer ion beams from cyclotrons can be used as in proton therapy to penetrate the body and kill tumors by radiation damage while minimizing damage to healthy tissue along their path cyclotron beams can be used to bombard other atoms to produce short-lived positron emitting isotopes suitable for pet imaging more recently some cyclotrons currently installed at hospitals for radio isotopes production have been retrofitted to enable them to produce technetium-99m 26 technetium-99m is a diagnostic isotope in short supply due to difficulties at canadas chalk river facility advantages and limitations edit the cyclotron was an improvement over the linear accelerators linac s that were available when it was invented being more cost and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field in the 1920s it was not possible to generate the high power high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs generated by klystrons as such impractically long linac structures were required for higher-energy particles the compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well such as foundations radiation shielding and the enclosing building cyclotrons have a single electrical driver which saves both money and power furthermore cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high the spiral path of the cyclotron beam can only sync up with klystron-type constant frequency voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying newtons laws of motion if the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field and cannot receive any additional acceleration the classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent of the speed of light to accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the isochronous cyclotrons operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the synchrocyclotrons either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern klystron driven linear accelerators both of which have the advantage of scalability offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger notable examples edit one of the worlds largest cyclotrons is at the riken laboratory in japan called the src for superconducting ring cyclotron it has six separated superconducting sectors and is 19m in diameter and 8m high built to accelerate heavy ions its maximum magnetic field is 3.8 t yielding a bending ability of 8tm the total weight of the cyclotron is 8300t the riken magnetic field covers from 35m radius to 55m with the maximum beam radius of about 5m 200in it has accelerated uranium ions to 345mev per atomic mass unit 27 triumf canadas national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics houses the worlds largest cyclotron 28 the 18m diameter 4000t main magnet produces a field of 046t while a 23mhz 94 kv electric field is used to accelerate the 300a beamthe triumf field goes from 0 to 813cm 0 to 320in radius with the maximum beam radius of 790cm 310in its large size is partly a result of using negative hydrogen ions rather than protons this requires a lower magnetic field to reduce em stripping of the loosely bound electrons the advantage is that extraction is simpler multi-energy multi-beams can be extracted by inserting thin carbon stripping foils at appropriate radii triumf is run by a consortium of eighteen canadian universities and is located at the university of british columbia related technologies edit the spiraling of electrons in a cylindrical vacuum chamber within a transverse magnetic field is also employed in the magnetron a device for producing high frequency radio waves microwaves the synchrotron moves the particles through a path of constant radius allowing it to be made as a pipe and so of much larger radius than is practical with the cyclotron and synchrocyclotron the larger radius allows the use of numerous magnets each of which imparts angular momentum and so allows particles of higher velocity mass to be kept within the bounds of the evacuated pipe the magnetic field strength of each of the bending magnets is increased as the particles gain energy in order to keep the bending angle constant in fiction edit the united states department of defense famously asked for dailies of the superman comic strip to be pulled in april 1945 for having superman bombarded with the radiation from a cyclotron 29 in 1950 however in atom man vs superman lex luthor uses a cyclotron to start an earthquake in the dc tv series the flash barry alen was hit by the lightning struck due to dr wells particle accelerator and became the flash
