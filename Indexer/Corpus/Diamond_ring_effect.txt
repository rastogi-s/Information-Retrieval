bailys beads wikipedia bailys beads the bailys beads effect or diamond ring effect is a feature of total and annular solar eclipses as the moon covers the sun during a solar eclipse the rugged topography of the lunar limb allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some places while not in others the effect is named after francis baily who explained the phenomenon in 1836 1 2 the diamond ring effect is seen when only one bead is left appearing as a shining diamond set in a bright ring around the lunar silhouette 3 lunar topography has considerable relief because of the presence of mountains craters valleys and other topographical features the irregularities of the lunar limb profile the edge of the moon as seen from a distance are known accurately from observations of grazing occultations of stars astronomers thus have a fairly good idea which mountains and valleys will cause the beads to appear in advance of the eclipse while bailys beads are seen briefly for a few seconds at the center of the eclipse path their duration is maximized near the edges of the path of the umbra lasting 12 minutes after the diamond ring effect has diminished the subsequent bailys beads effect and totality phase are safe to view without the solar filters used during the partial phases by then less than 0.001 of the suns photosphere is visible observers in the path of totality of a solar eclipse see first a gradual covering of the sun by the lunar silhouette for over an hour followed by the diamond ring effect visible without filters as the last bit of photosphere disappears as the burst of light from the ring fades baileys beads appear as the last bits of the bright photosphere shine through valleys aligned at the edge of the moon 4 as the bailys beads disappear behind the advancing lunar edge the beads also reappear at the end of totality a thin reddish edge called the chromosphere the greek chromos meaning color appears though the reddish hydrogen radiation is most visible to the unaided eye the chromosphere also emits thousands of additional spectral lines 5 observational history edit although baily is often said to have discovered the cause of the feature which bears his name sir edmond halley made the first recorded observations of bailys beads during the solar eclipse of 3 may 1715 6 note 1 halley described and correctly ascertained the cause of the effect 6 in his observations of the late total eclipse of the sun in the philosophical transactions of the royal society about two minutes before the total immersion the remaining part of the sun was reduced to a very fine horn whose extremeties seemed to lose their acuteness and to become round like stars which appearance could proceed from no other cause but the inequalities of the moons surface there being some elevated parts thereof near the moons southern pole by whose interposition part of that exceedingly fine filament of light was intercepted 6 in media edit cosmas damian asam was probably the earliest realistic painter to depict a total solar eclipse and diamond ring 7 his painting was finished in 1735 the bailys beads phenomenon is seen during the credit opening sequence of the nbc tv show heroes while the diamond ring effect is seen during the credit opening sequence of star trek voyager albeit from a fictitious extrasolar body seen from space
