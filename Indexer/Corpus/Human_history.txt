disciplines and for periods since the invention of writing from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies humanitys written history was preceded by its prehistory beginning with the palaeolithic era early stone age followed by the neolithic era new stone age the neolithic saw the agricultural revolution begin between 8000 and 5000 bce in the near east s fertile crescent the agricultural revolution marked a fundamental change in history with humans beginning the systematic husbandry of plants and animals 2 as agriculture advanced most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements the relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units fostered by advances in transportation whether in prehistoric or historic times people always had to be near reliable sources of potable water cities developed on river banks as early as 3000 bce when some of the first well-developed settlements arose in mesopotamia 3 on the banks of egypt s nile river 4 5 in the indus river valley 6 and along chinas rivers 7 8 as farming developed grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities which provided the foundation for civilization the growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing with civilizations flourishing ancient history antiquity including the classical age 9 up to about 500 ce 10 saw the rise and fall of empires post-classical history the middle ages c 5001500 ce 11 witnessed the rise of christianity the islamic golden age c 750 ce c 1258 ce and the early italian renaissance from around 1300 ce the early modern period sometimes referred to as the european age 12 from about 1500 to 1800 13 included the age of enlightenment and the age of discovery the mid-15th-century invention of modern printing employing movable type 14 revolutionized communication and facilitated ever wider dissemination of information helping end the middle ages and ushering in the scientific revolution 15 by the 18th century the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the industrial revolution 16 and began the late modern period which starts around 1800 and includes the current day 17 this scheme of historical periodization dividing history into antiquity post-classical early modern and late modern periods was developed for and applies best to the history of the old world particularly europe and the mediterranean outside this region including ancient china and ancient india historical timelines unfolded differently however by the 18th century due to extensive world trade and colonization the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined in the last quarter-millennium the rates of growth of population knowledge technology communications commerce weapons destructiveness and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated creating opportunities and perils that now confront the planets human communities 18 prehistory main articles prehistory and human evolution early humans genetic measurements indicate that the ape lineage which would lead to homo sapiens diverged from the lineage that would lead to the bonobo the closest living relative of modern humans around 4.6 to 6.2 million years ago 19 anatomically modern humans arose in africa about 200000 years ago 20 and reached behavioural modernity about 50000 years ago 21 modern humans spread rapidly from africa into the frost-free zones of europe and asia around 60000 years ago 22 the rapid expansion of humankind to north america and oceania took place at the climax of the most recent ice age when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable yet humans had colonized nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe by the end of the ice age some 12000 years ago 23 other hominids such as homo erectus had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia but as time progressed tools became far more refined and complex perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago but certainly by 500000 years ago humans began using fire for heat and cooking 24 they also developed language in the paleolithic period 25 and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory stone and bone showing a spirituality generally interpreted as animism or even shamanism 26 during this period all humans lived as hunter-gatherers and were generally nomadic 27 archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover 28 rise of civilization the neolithic revolution beginning around 10000 bce saw the development of agriculture which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle farming developed around 10000 bce in the middle east around 7000 bce in what is now china about 6000 bce in the indus valley and europe and about 4000 bce in the americas 29 cultivation of cereal crops and the domestication of animals occurred around 8500 bce in the middle east where wheat and barley were the first crops and sheep and goats were domesticated 30 in the indus valley crops were cultivated by 6000 bce along with domesticated cattle the yellow river valley in china cultivated millet and other cereal crops by about 7000 bce but the yangtze river valley domesticated rice earlier by at least 8000 bce in the americas sunflowers were cultivated by about 4000 bce and corn and beans were domesticated in central america by 3500 bce potatoes were first cultivated in the andes mountains of south america where the llama was also domesticated 29 metal-working starting with copper around 6000 bce was first used for tools and ornaments gold soon followed with its main use being for ornaments the need for metal ores stimulated trade as many of the areas of early human settlement were lacking in ores bronze an alloy of copper and tin is first known from about 2500 bce but did not become widely used until much later 31 though early cities appeared at jericho and catal huyuk around 6000 bce 32 the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 bce in egypt 33 and mesopotamia 34 these cultures gave birth to the invention of the wheel 35 mathematics 36 bronze-working sailing boats the pottery wheel woven cloth construction of monumental buildings 37 and writing 38 writing developed independently and at different times in five areas of the world 39 egypt c 3200 bce 39 india c 3200 bce 40 mesopotamia c 3000 bce 41 china c 1600 bce 42 and mesoamerica c 600 bce 39 farming permitted far denser populations which in time organized into states agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production 43 the development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first cities these were centres of trade manufacturing and political power 44 cities established a symbiosis with their surrounding countrysides absorbing agricultural products and providing in return manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection the development of cities was synonymous with the rise of civilization a early civilizations arose first in lower mesopotamia 3000 bce 46 47 followed by egyptian civilization along the nile river 3000 bce 5 the harappan civilization in the indus river valley in present-day india and pakistan 2500 bce 48 49 and chinese civilization along the yellow and yangtze rivers 2200 bce 7 8 these societies developed a number of unifying characteristics including a central government a complex economy and social

was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing cuneiform script appeared around 3000 bce 39 51 cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs these pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract 51 cuneiform texts were written on clay tablets on which symbols were drawn with a blunt reed used as a stylus 39 writing made the administration of a large state far easier transport was facilitated by waterwaysby rivers and seas the mediterranean sea at the juncture of three continents fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods ideas and inventions this era also saw new land technologies such as horse-based cavalry and chariots that allowed armies to move faster these developments led to the rise of territorial states

dual division into upper and lower egypt which was shortly followed by unification of all the valley around 3100 bce followed by permanent pacification 52 in crete the minoan civilization had entered

and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects the great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres the relative peace that the empires brought encouraged international trade most notably the massive trade routes in the mediterranean the maritime trade web in the indian ocean and the silk road in southern europe the greeks and later the romans in an era known as classical antiquity

but steady technological advances with important developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plough arriving every few centuries there were however in some regions periods of rapid technological progress most important perhaps was the mediterranean area during the hellenistic period when hundreds of technologies were invented 73 such periods were followed by periods of technological decay as during the roman empire s decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period declines falls and resurgence the empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy these costs fell most heavily on the peasantry while land-owning magnates increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution china s han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 ce beginning the three kingdoms period while its roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the crisis of the third century the great empires of eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains from the central asian steppes horse-based nomads mainly mongols and turks dominated a large part of the continent the development of the stirrup and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the

most of the near east north africa and parts of europe ushering in an era of learning science and invention known as the islamic golden age the knowledge and skills of the ancient near east greece and persia were preserved in the postclassical era by muslims who also added new and important innovations from outside such as the manufacture of paper from china and decimal positional numbering from india much of this learning and development can be linked to geography even prior to islams presence the city of mecca had served as a centre of trade in arabia and the islamic prophet muhammad himself was a merchant with the new islamic tradition of the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas the influence held by muslim merchants over

who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility merchants brought goods and their islamic faith to china india southeast asia and the kingdoms of western africa and returned with new discoveries and inventions motivated by religion and dreams of conquest european kings launched a number of crusades to try to roll back muslim power and retake the holy land the crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the byzantine empire especially with the 1204 sack of constantinople which began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the ottoman turks arab

refer to the period between the middle ages post-classical history and the industrial revolution roughly 1500 to 1800 13 the early modern period is characterized by the rise of science and by increasingly rapid technological progress secularized civic politics and the nation state capitalist economies began their rise initially in northern italian republics such as genoa the early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the mercantilist economic theory as such the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance in much of the european sphere of feudalism serfdom and the power of the catholic church the period includes the protestant reformation the disastrous thirty years war the age of discovery european colonial expansion the peak of european witch-hunting the scientific revolution and the age of enlightenment c renaissance main article renaissance europe s renaissance beginning in the 14th century and extending into the 16th consisted of the rediscovery of the classical worlds scientific contributions and of the economic and social rise of europe the renaissance also engendered a culture of inquisitiveness which ultimately led to humanism 111 and the scientific revolution 112 although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many intellectual pursuits the renaissance is perhaps known best for its artistic developments citation needed and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo who inspired the term renaissance man european expansion further information history of europe age of discovery colonialism 16th century and 17th century during this period european powers came to dominate most of the world although the most developed regions of european classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world european civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse during the early modern period europe was able to regain its dominance historians still debate the causes europes success in this period stands in contrast to other regions for example one of the most advanced civilizations of the middle ages was china it had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1000 ce china had a free peasantry who were no longer subsistence farmers and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market according to adam smith writing in the 18th century china had long been one of the richest most fertile best cultivated most industrious most urbanized and most prosperous countries in the world it enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production piston bellows suspension bridge construction printing and the compass however it seemed to have long since stopped progressing marco polo who visited china in the 13th century describes its cultivation industry and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century one theory of europes rise holds that europes geography played an important role in its success the middle east india and china are all ringed by mountains and oceans but once past these outer barriers are nearly flat by contrast the pyrenees alps apennines carpathians and other mountain ranges run through europe and the continent is also divided by several seas this gave europe some degree of protection from the peril of central asian invaders before the era of firearms these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the eurasian continent and as they broke out into the plains of northern india or the valleys of china were all but unstoppable these invasions were often devastating the golden age of islam was ended by the mongol sack of baghdad in 1258 india and china were subject to periodic invasions and russia spent a couple of centuries under the mongol-tatar yoke central and western europe logistically more distant from the central asian heartland proved less vulnerable to these threats geography contributed to important geopolitical differences for most of their histories china india and the middle east were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts citation needed in 1600 the ottoman empire controlled almost all the middle east 113 the ming dynasty ruled china 114 115 and the mughal empire held sway over india by contrast europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states pan-european empires with the notable exception of the roman empire tended to collapse soon after they arose another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of europe was the mediterranean sea which for millennia had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods people ideas and inventions nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their environments productivity remained low and climatic changes easily instigated boom-and-bust cycles that brought about civilizations rise and fall by about 1500 however there was a qualitative change in world history technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about a widening of possibilities 116 many have also argued that europes institutions allowed it to expand that property rights and free-market economics were stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of freedom peculiar to europe in recent years however scholars such as kenneth pomeranz have challenged this view europes maritime expansion unsurprisinglygiven the continents geographywas largely the work of its atlantic states portugal spain england france and the netherlands initially the portuguese and spanish empires were the predominant conquerors and sources of influence and their union resulted in the iberian union the first global empire on which the sun never set soon the more northern english french and dutch began to dominate the atlantic in a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries culminating with the napoleonic wars britain emerged as the new world power regional developments persia came under the rule of the safavid empire in 1501 succeeded by the afsharid empire in 1736 and the qajar empire in 1796 areas to the north and east were held by uzbeks and pashtuns the ottoman empire after taking constantinople in 1453 quickly gained control of the middle east the balkans and most of north africa in africa this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others the swahili coast declined after coming under portuguese and later omani control in west africa the songhai empire fell to the moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns the south african kingdom of zimbabwe gave way to smaller kingdoms such as mutapa butua and rozwi ethiopia suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring muslim adal sultanate and in 1769 entered the zemene mesafint age of princes during which the emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords though the royal line later would recover under emperor tewodros ii the ajuran empire in the horn of africa began to decline in the 17th century succeeded by the geledi sultanate other civilizations in africa advanced during this period the oyo empire experienced its golden age as did the benin empire the ashanti empire rose to power in what is modern day ghana in 1670 the kingdom of kongo also thrived during this period european exploration of africa reached its zenith at this time in the far east the chinese ming dynasty gave way 1644 to the qing the last chinese imperial dynasty which would rule until 1912 japan experienced its azuchimomoyama period 15681603 followed by the edo period 16031868 the korean joseon dynasty 13921910 ruled throughout this period successfully repelling 16th and 17th-century invasions from japan and china japan and china were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with europe particularly the portuguese in japan during the edo period japan would pursue isolationist policies to eliminate foreign influences on the indian subcontinent the delhi sultanate and the deccan sultanates would give way beginning in the 16th century to the mughal empire citation needed starting in the northwest the mughal empire would by the late 17th century come to rule the entire subcontinent 117 except for the southernmost indian provinces which would remain independent against the muslim mughal empire the hindu maratha empire was founded on the west coast in 1674 gradually gaining territorya majority of present-day indiafrom the mughals over several decades particularly in the mughalmaratha wars 16811701 the maratha empire would in 1818 fall under the control of the british east india company with all former maratha and mughal authority devolving in 1858 to the british raj in 1511 the portuguese overthrew the malacca sultanate in present-day malaysia and indonesian sumatra the portuguese held this important trading territory and the valuable associated navigational strait until overthrown by the dutch in 1641 the johor sultanate centred on the southern tip of the malay peninsula became the dominant trading power in the region european colonization expanded with the dutch in the netherlands east indies and the spanish in the philippines into the 19th century european expansion would affect the whole of southeast asia with the british in myanmar and malaysia and the establishment of french indochina only thailand would successfully resist colonization the pacific islands of oceania would also be affected by european contact starting with the circumnavigational voyage of ferdinand magellan who landed on the marianas and other islands in 1521 also notable were the voyages 164244 of abel tasman to present-day australia new zealand and nearby islands and the voyages 17681779 of captain james cook who made the first recorded european contact with hawaii britain would found its first colony on australia in 1788 in the americas the western european powers vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents largely displacing the indigenous populations and destroying the advanced civilizations of the aztecs and the inca spain portugal britain and france all made extensive territorial claims and undertook large-scale settlement including the importation of large numbers of african slaves portugal claimed brazil spain claimed the rest of south america mesoamerica and southern north america britain colonized the east coast of north america and france colonized the central region of north america russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of north america with a first colony in present-day alaska in 1784 and the outpost of fort ross in present-day california in 1812 118 in 1762 in the midst of the seven years war france secretly ceded most of its north american claims to spain in the treaty of fontainebleau thirteen of the british colonies declared independence as the united states of america in 1776 ratified by the treaty of paris in 1783 ending the american revolutionary war napoleon bonaparte won frances claims back from spain in the napoleonic wars in 1800 but sold them to the united states in 1803 as the louisiana purchase in russia ivan the terrible was crowned 1547 the first tsar of russia and by annexing the turkic khanates in the east transformed russia into a regional power the countries of western europe while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant war often the wars had a religious dimension either catholic versus protestant or primarily in eastern europe christian versus muslim wars of particular note include the thirty years war the war of the spanish succession the seven years war and the french revolutionary wars napoleon came to power in

advances begin to be applied substantially to practical invention the industrial revolution began in great britain and used new modes of productionthe factory mass production and mechanization to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required the age of enlightenment also led to the beginnings of modern democracy in the late-18th century american and french revolutions democracy and republicanism would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on quality of life after europeans had achieved influence and control over the americas imperial

africa with large numbers of british colonists emigrating to these colonies russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of siberia in the late 19th century the european powers divided the remaining areas of africa within europe economic and military challenges created a system of nation states and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy this nationalism would become important to peoples across the world in the 20th century during the second industrial revolution the world economy became reliant on coal as a fuel as new methods of transport such as railways and steamships effectively shrank the world meanwhile industrial pollution and environmental damage present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization accelerated drastically the advantages that europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two an entrepreneurial culture 119 and the wealth generated by the atlantic trade including the african slave trade by the late 16th century silver from the americas accounted for the spanish empires wealth citation needed the profits of the slave trade and of west indian plantations amounted to 5 of the british economy at the time of the industrial revolution 120 while some historians conclude that in 1750 labour productivity in the most developed regions of china was still on a par with that of europes atlantic economy 121 other historians like angus maddison hold that the per-capita productivity of western europe had by the late middle ages surpassed that of all

century unfolded however the global system dominated by rival powers was subjected to severe strains and ultimately seemed to yield to a more fluid structure of independent nations organized on western models this transformation was catalysed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation world war i destroyed many of europes empires and monarchies and weakened britain and france in its aftermath powerful ideologies arose the russian revolution of 1917 created the first communist state while the 1920s and 1930s saw militaristic fascist dictatorships gain control in italy germany

the development of nuclear weapons during world war ii and with their subsequent proliferation all of humanity were put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers as demonstrated by many incidents most prominently the october 1962 cuban missile crisis such war being viewed as impractical proxy wars were instead waged at the expense of non-nuclear-armed third world countries the cold war ended in 1991 when the soviet union disintegrated in part due to inability to compete economically with the united states and western europe however the united states likewise began to show signs of slippage in her geopolitical influence 126 even as her private sector now less inhibited by the claims of the public sector increasingly sought private advantage to the prejudice of the public weal

gradually formed a political and economic community the european union which expanded eastward to include former soviet-satellite countries 129 130 131 the european unions effectiveness was handicapped by the immaturity of its common economic and political institutions somewhat comparable to the inadequacy of united states institutions under the articles of confederation prior to the adoption of the us constitution that came into force in 1789 asian and african countries followed suit and began taking tentative steps toward forming their own respective continental associations cold war preparations to deter or to fight a third world war accelerated advances in technologies that though conceptualized before world war ii had been implemented for that wars exigencies such as jet aircraft rocketry and electronic computers in the decades after world war ii these advances led to jet travel artificial satellites with innumerable applications including global positioning systems gps and the internet inventions that have revolutionized the movement of people ideas and information however not all scientific and technological advances in the second half of the 20th century required an initial military impetus that period also saw ground-breaking developments such as the discovery of the structure of dna 132 the consequent sequencing of the human genome the worldwide eradication of smallpox the discovery of plate tectonics manned and unmanned exploration of space and of previously inaccessible parts of mankinds home planet and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities particle physics to the greatest entity physical cosmology the century saw several global threats emerge or become more serious or more widely recognized including nuclear proliferation global climate change 133 134 135 deforestation ocean acidification overpopulation deadly epidemics of microbial diseases near-earth asteroids and comets 136

eliminate all nuclear weapons such weapons continue to be equally hazardous to their owners as to their potential targets 138 139 the 21st century has been marked by growing economic globalization and

ancient and populous asian civilizations india and especially china have been emerging from centuries of relative scientific technological and economic languishment to become potential rivals for western chiefly european and united states economic and political ascendance in the world 141 worldwide demand and competition for resources has risen due to growing populations and industrialization especially in india china and brazil see list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita this increased demand is causing increased levels of environmental degradation and a fast-growing threat of disastrous global warming that and a need for reliable energy supplies independent of politically volatile regions has spurred the development of alternative renewable sources of energy notably solar energy and wind energy proposals for cleaner fossil-fuel technologies 142 and for expanded use of nuclear energy somewhat dampened by nuclear-plant accidents 143 144 and conversely calls
