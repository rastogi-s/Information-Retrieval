metonic cycle wikipedia metonic cycle for astronomy and calendar studies the metonic cycle or enneadecaeteris from ancient greek nineteen years is a period of very close to 19 years that is nearly a common multiple of the solar year and the synodic lunar month the greek astronomer meton of athens fifth century bc observed that a period of 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 synodic months and rounded to full days counts 6940 days the difference between the two periods of 19 years and 235 synodic months is only a few hours depending on the definition of the year considering a year to be 1 19 of this 6940-day cycle gives a year length of 365 1 4 1 76 days the unrounded cycle is much more accurate which is about 11 days more than 12 synodic months to keep a 12-month lunar year in pace with the solar year an intercalary 13th month would have to be added on seven occasions during the nineteen-year period 235 19 12 7 when meton introduced the cycle around 432bc it was already known by babylonian astronomers a mechanical computation of the cycle is built into the antikythera mechanism the cycle was used in the babylonian calendar ancient chinese calendar systems the rule cycle and the medieval computus ie the calculation of the date of easter it regulates the 19-year cycle of intercalary months of the modern hebrew calendar the start of the metonic cycle depends on which of these systems is being used for easter the first year of the current metonic cycle is 2014 mathematical basis edit at the time of meton axial precession had not yet been discovered and he could not distinguish between sidereal years currently 365.256363 days and tropical years currently 365.242190 days most calendars like the commonly used gregorian calendar are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 synodic months the metonic cycles error is therefore one full day every 219 years or 12.4 parts per million 19 tropical years 6939602 days 12 354-day years 7 384-day years 3.6 days 235 synodic months lunar phases 6939688 days metonic period by definition 254 sidereal months lunar orbits 6939702 days 19 235 254 255 draconic months lunar nodes 69391161 days note that the 19-year cycle is also close to somewhat more than half a day to 255 draconic months so it is also an eclipse cycle which lasts only for about 4 or 5 recurrences of eclipses the octon is 1 5 of a metonic cycle 47 synodic months 3.8 years and it recurs about 20 to 25 cycles this cycle seems to be a coincidence the periods of the moons orbit around the earth and the earths orbit around the sun are believed to be independent and not to have any known physical resonance an example of a non-coincidental cycle is the orbit of mercury with its 32 spin-orbit resonance a lunar year of 12 synodic months is about 354 days approximately 11 days short of the 365-day solar year therefore for a lunisolar calendar every 2 to 3 years there is a difference of more than a full lunar month between the lunar and solar years and an extra embolismic month needs to be inserted intercalation the athenians initially seem not to have had a regular means of intercalating a 13th month instead the question of when to add a month was decided by an official metons discovery made it possible to propose a regular intercalation scheme the babylonians seem to have introduced this scheme around 500 bc thus well before meton application in traditional calendars edit traditionally for the babylonian and hebrew lunisolar calendars the years 3 6 8 11 14 17 and 19 are the long 13-month years of the metonic cycle this cycle which can be used to predict eclipses forms the basis of the greek and hebrew calendars and is used for the computation of the date of easter each year the babylonians applied the 19-year cycle since the late sixth century bc as they measured the moons motion against the stars the 23519 relationship may originally have referred to sidereal years instead of tropical years as it has been used for various calendars according to livy the king of rome numa pompilius 753-673 bc inserted intercalary months in such a way that in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started 3 as the twentieth year takes place nineteen years after the first year this seems to indicate that the metonic cycle was applied to numas calendar apollo was said to have visited the hyperboreans once every 19 years presumably at the high point of the cycle the runic calendar is a perpetual calendar based on the 19-year-long metonic cycle also known as a rune staff or runic almanac it appears to have been a medieval swedish invention this calendar does not rely on knowledge of the duration of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years it is set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice the oldest one known and the only one from the middle ages is the nykping staff which is believed to date from the 13th century the bah calendar established during the middle of the 19th century is also based on cycles of 19 years further details edit the metonic cycle is related to two less accurate subcycles 8 years 99 lunations an octaeteris to within 1.5 days ie an error of one day in 5 years and 11 years 136 lunations within 1.5 days ie an error of one day in 7.3 years by combining appropriate numbers of 11-year and 19-year periods it is possible to generate ever more accurate cycles for example simple arithmetic shows that 687 tropical years 25092139 days 8497 lunations 25092141 days this gives an error of only about half an hour in 687 years 2.5 seconds a year although this is subject to secular variation in the length of the tropical year and the lunation meton of athens approximated the cycle to a whole number 6940 of days obtained by 125 long months of 30 days and 110 short months of 29 days during the next century callippus developed the callippic cycle of four 19-year periods for a 76-year cycle with a mean year of exactly 365.25 days
