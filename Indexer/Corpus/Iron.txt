iron wikipedia iron this article is about the metallic element for other uses see iron disambiguation iron is a chemical element with symbol fe from latin ferrum and atomic number 26 it is a metal in the first transition series it is by mass the most common element on earth forming much of earths outer and inner core it is the fourth most common element in the earths crust its abundance in rocky planets like earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova which scatters the iron into space like the other group 8 elements ruthenium and osmium iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states 2 to 7 although 2 and 3 are the most common elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments but is reactive to oxygen and water fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides commonly known as rust unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion iron metal has been used since ancient times although copper alloys which have lower melting temperatures were used even earlier in human history pure iron is relatively soft but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities in particular carbon from the smelting process a certain proportion of carbon between 0.002 and 2.1 produces steel which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron which has a high carbon content further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel steels and iron alloys formed with other metals alloy steels are by far the most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant iron chemical compounds have many uses iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction used in welding and purifying ores iron forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene the first sandwich compound discovered iron plays an important role in biology forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals in adult human males are some 3.8 grams of iron and 2.3 grams in females for whom iron is distributed in hemoglobin and throughout the body iron is a critical element in the metabolism of hundreds of proteins and enzymes involved in diverse body functions such as oxygen transport dna synthesis and cell growth 5 characteristics mechanical properties the mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests including the brinell test rockwell test and the vickers hardness test the data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests 7 8 however the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the samples purity pure single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium 6 and the purest industrially produced iron 99.99 has a hardness of 2030brinell 9 an increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the hardness and tensile strength of iron maximum hardness of 65 r c is achieved with a 0.6 carbon content although the alloy has low tensile strength 10 because of the softness of iron it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium 11 because of its significance for planetary cores the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively the form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to ca 15gpa before transforming into a high-pressure form as described in the next section phase diagram and allotropes main article allotropes of iron iron represents an example of allotropy in a metal at least four allotropic forms of iron are known as and at very high pressures and temperatures some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable phase 12 as molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538c it crystallizes into its allotrope which has a body-centered cubic bcc crystal structure as it cools further to 1394c it changes to its iron allotrope a face-centered cubic fcc crystal structure or austenite at 912c and below the crystal structure again becomes the bcc iron allotrope finally at 770c the curie point t c irons magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic as is passes through the curie temperature iron does not change its structure but magnetic domains appear where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin in unmagnetized iron all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation however the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field in magnetized iron the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced although each domain contains billions of atoms they are very small about 10micrometres across 13 this happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the d z 2 and d x 2 y 2 orbitals which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding thus they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align 14 at pressures above approximately 10 gpa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed hcp structure which is also known as iron the higher-temperature phase also changes into iron but does so at higher pressure the phase if it exists would appear at pressures of at least 50 gpa and temperatures of at least 1500 k and have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure 12 these high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the solid parts of planetary cores the inner core of the earth is generally presumed to be an iron nickel alloy with or structure 15 somewhat confusingly the term iron is sometimes also used to refer to iron above its curie point when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic even though its crystal structure has not changed 14 the melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50gpa for greater pressures studies put the liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000k in the melting point generally speaking molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points and a much steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells 16 the melting and boiling points of iron along with its enthalpy of atomization are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus 17 however they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized this same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium 11 isotopes main article isotopes of iron naturally occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes 5.845 of 54 fe 91.754 of 56 fe 2.119 of 57 fe and 0.282 of 58 fe of these stable isotopes only 57 fe has a nuclear spin 1 2 the nuclide 54 fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54 cr but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3110 22 years has been established 18 60 fe is an extinct radionuclide of long half-life 26million years 19 it is not found on earth but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter the stable nuclide 60 ni 18 much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the nucleosynthesis of 60 fe through studies of meteorite s and ore formation in the last decade advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the detection and quantification of minute naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron much of this work is driven by the earth and planetary science communities although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging 20 in phases of the meteorites semarkona and chervony kut a correlation between the concentration of 60 ni the granddaughter of 60 fe and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60 fe at the time of formation of the solar system possibly the energy released by the decay of 60 fe along with that released by 26 al contributed to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 46billion years ago the abundance of 60 ni present in extraterrestrial material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the solar system 21 the most abundant iron isotope 56 fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis 22 since 56 ni 14 alpha particles is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae see silicon burning process it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars since addition of another alpha particle resulting in 60 zn requires a great deal more energy this 56 ni which has a half-life of about 6days is created in quantity in these stars but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud first to radioactive 56 co and then to stable 56 fe as such iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as earth 23 it is also very common in the universe relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight 23 24 iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and the most common refractory element 25 although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62 ni which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56 fe conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process element production in supernovas and distribution on earth greatly favor iron over nickel and in any case 56 fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62 ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons 26 hence elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56 fe nuclei 23 in the far future of the universe assuming that proton decay does not occur cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56 fe nuclei fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron 27 occurrence see also categoryiron minerals metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the earth because it tends to oxidize but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores while it makes up about 5 of the earths crust both the earths inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron nickel alloy constituting 35 of the mass of the earth as a whole iron is consequently the most abundant element on earth but only the fourth most abundant element in the earths crust after oxygen silicon and aluminium 28 most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite fe 2 o 3 magnetite fe 3 o 4 and siderite feco 3 many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite 29 30 ferropericlase mgfeo a solid solution of periclase mgo and wstite feo makes up about 20 of the volume of the lower mantle of the earth which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate perovskite mgfesio 3 it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle 31 at the bottom of the transition zone of the mantle the reaction mgfe 2 sio 4 mgfesio 3 mgfeo transforms olivine into a mixture of perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa in the literature this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiowstite 32 silicate perovskite may form up to 93 of the lower mantle 33 and the magnesium iron form mgfesio 3 is considered to be the most abundant mineral in the earth making up 38 of its volume 34 large deposits of iron are found in banded iron formations these geological formations are a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor shale and chert the banded iron formations were laid down in the time between 3700 million years ago and 1800 million years ago 35 36 the mentioned iron compounds have been used as pigment s compare ochre since historical time and contribute as well to the color of various geological formations eg the buntsandstein british bunter colored sandstein 37 in the case of the eisensandstein a jurassic iron sandstone eg from donzdorf in germany 38 and bath stone in the uk iron pigments contribute to the yellowish color of large amounts of historical buildings and sculptures 39 the proverbial red color of the surface of mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich regolith 40 significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral pyrite fes 2 but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used in fact iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it during weathering iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated ph as ironiii oxide 41 about 1 in 20 meteorites consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals taenite 3580 iron and kamacite 9095 iron although rare iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the earths surface 42 according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200kg per capita more-developed countries differ in this respect from less-developed countries 700014000 vs 2000kg per capita 43 chemistry and compounds see also categoryiron compounds iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry indeed it was the discovery of an iron compound ferrocene that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s 44 iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity 45 its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration ar3d 6 4s 2 of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable 11 iron forms compounds mainly in the 2 and 3 oxidation states traditionally ironii compounds are called ferrous and ironiii compounds ferric iron also occurs in higher oxidation states eg the purple potassium ferrate k 2 feo 4 which contains iron in its 6 oxidation state although ironviii oxide feo 4 has been claimed the report could not be reproduced and such a species at least with iron in its 8 oxidation state has been found to be improbable computationally 46 however one form of anionic feo 4 with iron in its 7 oxidation state along with an ironv-peroxo isomer has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4 k after cocondensation of laser-ablated fe atoms with a mixture of o 2 ar 47 ironiv is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions 48 49 numerous organometallic compounds contain formal oxidation states of 1 0 1 or even 2 the oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of mssbauer spectroscopy 50 many mixed valence compounds contain both ironii and ironiii centers such as magnetite and prussian blue fe 4 fecn 6 3 49 the latter is used as the traditional blue in blueprints 51 iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of 8 although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium 14 ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron but osmium does not favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes 14 in fact in this second half of the 3d transition series vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry as such iron cobalt and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad 45 the iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are ironii sulfate feso 4 7 h 2 o and ironiii chloride fecl 3 the former is one of the most readily available sources of ironii but is less stable to aerial oxidation than mohrs salt nh 4 2 feso 4 2 6h 2 o ironii compounds tend to be oxidized to ironiii compounds in the air 49 unlike many other metals iron does not form amalgams with mercury as a result mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks 34kg made of iron 52 iron is by far the most reactive element in its group it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids giving fe 2 however it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid 14 binary compounds iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various oxide and hydroxide compounds the most common are ironiiiii oxide fe 3 o 4 and ironiii oxide fe 2 o 3 ironii oxide also exists though it is unstable at room temperature despite their names they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary 53 these oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron see bloomery and blast furnace they are also used in the production of ferrites useful magnetic storage media in computers and pigments the best known sulfide is iron pyrite fes 2 also known as fools gold owing to its golden luster 49 it is not an ironiv compound but is actually an ironii polysulfide containing fe 2 and s 2 2 ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure 53 the binary ferrous and ferric halides are well-known with the exception of ferric iodide the ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydrohalic acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts 49 fe 2 hx fex 2 h 2 x f cl br i iron reacts with fluorine chlorine and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides ferric chloride being the most common 54 2 fe 3 x 2 2 fex 3 x f cl br ferric iodide is an exception being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of fe 3 and the high reducing power of i 54 2 i 2 fe 3 i 2 2 fe 2 e 0 0.23 v nevertheless milligram amounts of ferric iodide a black solid may still be prepared through the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon monoxide in the presence of hexane and light at the temperature of 20c making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water 54 solution chemistry the standard reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common iron ions are given below 14 the red-purple tetrahedral ferrate vi anion is such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature and even water itself in acidic or neutral solutions 54 4 feo 2 4 10 h 2 o 4 fe 3 20 oh 3 o 2 the fe 3 ion has a large simple cationic chemistry although the pale-violet hexaquo ion feh 2 o 6 3 is very readily hydrolyzed when ph increases above 0 as follows 55 dark red ironiii oxide blue-green ironii sulfate heptahydrate as ph rises above 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above 23 reddish-brown hydrous ironiii oxide precipitates out of solution although fe 3 has an d 5 configuration its absorption spectrum is not like that of mn 2 with its weak spin-forbidden dd bands because fe 3 has higher positive charge and is more polarizing lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions thus all the above complexes are rather strongly colored with the single exception of the hexaquo ion and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region 55 on the other hand the pale green ironii hexaquo ion feh 2 o 6 2 does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added which instead results in white ironii carbonate being precipitated out in excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate which occurs commonly in groundwater but it oxidises quickly in air to form ironiii oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams 56 coordination compounds many coordination compounds of iron are known a typical six-coordinate anion is hexachloroferrateiii fecl 6 3 found in the mixed salt tetrakismethylammonium hexachloroferrateiii chloride 57 58 complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have geometric isomers for example the trans chlorohydridobisbis-12-diphenylphosphinoethaneironii complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the fe dppe 2 moiety 59 60 the ferrioxalate ion with three oxalate ligands shown at right displays helical chirality with its two non-superposable geometries labelled lambda for the left-handed screw axis and delta for the right-handed screw axis in line with iupac conventions 55 potassium ferrioxalate is used in chemical actinometry and along with its sodium salt undergoes photoreduction applied in old-style photographic processes the dihydrate of ironii oxalate has a polymeric structure with co-planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron as illustrated below 61 ball-and-stick model of a chain in the crystal structure of ironii oxalate dihydrate prussian blue fe 4 fecn 6 3 is the most famous of the cyanide complexes of iron its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of fe 2 and fe 3 as they react respectively with potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide to form prussian blue 49 ironiii complexes are quite similar to those of chromium iii with the exception of ironiiis preference for o donor instead of n donor ligands the latter tend to be rather more unstable than ironii complexes and often dissociate in water many feo complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for phenols or enols for example in the ferric chloride test used to determine the presence of phenols ironiii chloride reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex 55 3 aroh fecl 3 feoar 3 3 hcl ar aryl among the halide and pseudohalide complexes fluoro complexes of ironiii are the most stable with the colorless fef 5 h 2 o 2 being the most stable in aqueous solution chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in fecl 4 finally febr 4 and fei 4 reduce themselves easily to ironii thiocyanate is a common test for the presence of ironiii as it forms the blood-red fescnh 2 o 5 2 like manganeseii most ironiii complexes are high-spin the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the spectrochemical series such as cyanide an example of a low-spin ironiii complex is fecn 6 3 the cyanide ligands may easily be detached in fecn 6 3 and hence this complex is poisonous unlike the ironii complex fecn 6 4 found in prussian blue 55 which does not release hydrogen cyanide except when dilute acids are added 56 iron shows a great variety of electronic spin states including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 diamagnetic to 5 2 5 unpaired electrons this value is always half the number of unpaired electrons complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin 53 ironii complexes are less stable than ironiii complexes but the preference for o donor ligands is less marked so that for example fenh 3 6 2 is known while fenh 3 6 3 is not they have a tendency to be oxidized to ironiii but this can be moderated by low ph and the specific ligands used 56 organometallic compounds fulvalene which pauson and kealy sought to prepare the incorrect structure for ferrocene that pauson and kealy proposed the structural formula of ferrocene see also organoiron chemistry cyanide complexes are technically organometallic but more important are carbonyl complexes and sandwich and half-sandwich compounds the premier iron0 compound is iron pentacarbonyl feco 5 which is used to produce carbonyl iron powder a highly reactive form of metallic iron thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster triiron dodecacarbonyl collmans reagent disodium tetracarbonylferrate is a useful reagent for organic chemistry it contains iron in the 2 oxidation state cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare 1 oxidation state 62 ferrocene was an extremely important compound in the early history of the branch of organometallic chemistry and to this day iron is still one of the most important metals in this field 63 it was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fulvalene c 10 h 8 by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene the resultant product was found to have molecular formula c 10 h 10 fe and reported to exhibit remarkable stability 64 the discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry 65 66 in part because the structure proposed by pauson and kealy shown at right was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability consequently the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood the shockingly novel sandwich structure fe 5 c 5 h 5 2 65 was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952 robert burns woodward and geoffrey wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure 67 and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule such as benzene 68 ernst otto fischer deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene 69 eiland and pepinsky provided x-ray crystallographic confirmation of the sandwich structure 70 applying valence bond theory to ferrocene by considering an fe 2 centre and two cyclopentadienide anions c 5 h 5 which are known to be aromatic according to hckels rule and hence highly stable allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied and the dewar-chatt-duncanson model proposed 71 the reasons for ferrocenes remarkable stability became clear 72 ferrocene was not the first organometallic compound known zeises salt kptcl 3 c 2 h 4 h 2 o was reported in 1831 73 74 and monds discovery of nico 4 occurred in 1888 75 but it was ferrocenes discovery that began organometallic chemistry as a separate area of chemistry it was so important that wilkinson and fischer shared the 1973 nobel prize for chemistry for their pioneering work performed independently on the chemistry of the organometallic so called sandwich compounds 76 ferrocene itself can be used as the backbone of a ligand eg 11-bisdiphenylphosphinoferrocene dppf ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation fc the ferroceneferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry 66 metallocenes like ferrocene can be prepared by reaction of freshly-cracked cyclopentadiene with ironii chloride and base 77 it is an aromatic substance and undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions on the cyclopentadienyl ligands for example friedel-crafts acylation of ferrocene with acetic anhydride yields acetylferrocene 78 just as acylation of benzene yields acetophenone under similar conditions iron-centered organometallic species are used as catalysts the knlker complex for example is a transfer hydrogenation catalyst for ketones 79 etymology as iron has been in use for such a long time it has many different names in different languages the source of its chemical symbol fe is the latin word ferrum and its descendants are the names of the element in the romance languages for example french fer spanish hierro and italian and portuguese ferro 80 the word ferrum itself possibly comes from the semitic languages via etruscan from a root that also gave rise to old english brs brass 81 the english word iron derives ultimately from proto-germanic isarnan which is also the source of the german name eisen it was most likely borrowed from celtic isarnon which ultimately comes from proto-indo-european is-ero powerful holy and finally eis strong referencing irons strength as a metal 82 kluge relates isarnon to illyric and latin ira wrath 4 the balto-slavic names for iron for example russian zhelezo are the only ones to come directly from the proto-indo-european g h elg h iron 83 in many of these languages the word for iron may also be used to denote other objects made of iron or steel or figuratively because of the hardness and strength of the metal 84 the chinese ti traditional simplified derives from proto-sino-tibetan hliek 85 and was borrowed into japanese as tetsu which also has the native reading kurogane black metal similar to how iron is referenced in the english word blacksmith 86 history main article history of ferrous metallurgy wrought iron further information ancient iron production iron belongs to the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world 87 it has been worked or wrought for millennia however iron objects of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease with which iron corrodes 88 beads made from meteoric iron in 3500bc or earlier were found in gerzah egypt by g a wainwright 89 the beads contain 7.5 nickel which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the earths crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools 89 for example a dagger made of meteoric iron was found in the tomb of tutankhamun containing similar proportions of iron cobalt and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area deposited by an ancient meteor shower 90 91 92 items that were likely made of iron by egyptians date from 3000 to 2500bc 88 meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content 93 the first iron production started in the middle bronze age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze samples of smelted iron from asmar mesopotamia and tall chagar bazaar in northern syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700bc 94 the hittites established an empire in north-central anatolia around 1600 bc they appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society 95 the hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200bc and the practice spread to the rest of the near east after their empire fell in 1180bc 94 the subsequent period is called the iron age artifacts of smelted iron are found in india dating from 1800 to 1200bc 96 and in the levant from about 1500bc suggesting smelting in anatolia or the caucasus 97 98 alleged references compare history of metallurgy in south asia to iron in the indian vedas have been used for claims of a very early usage of iron in india respectively to date the texts as such the rigveda term ayas metal probably refers to copper and bronze while iron or yma ayas literally black metal first is mentioned in the post-rigvedic atharvaveda 99 some archaeological evidence suggests iron was smelted in zimbabwe and southeast africa as early as the eighth century bc 100 iron working was introduced to greece in the late 11th centurybc from which it spread quickly throughout europe 101 the spread of ironworking in central and western europe is associated with celtic expansion according to pliny the elder iron use was common in the roman era 89 the annual iron output of the roman empire is estimated at 84750 t 102 while the similarly populous and contemporary han china produced around 5000 t 103 in china iron only appears circa 700500bc 104 iron smelting may have been introduced into china through central asia 105 the earliest evidence of the use of a blast furnace in china dates to the 1st century ad 106 and cupola furnaces were used as early as the warring states period 403221 bc 107 usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the song and tang dynasties 108 during the industrial revolution in britain henry cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron or bar iron using innovative production systems in 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore it was later improved by others including joseph hall 109 cast iron cast iron was first produced in china during 5th century bc 110 but was hardly in europe until the medieval period 111 112 the earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern luhe county jiangsu in china cast iron was used in ancient china for warfare agriculture and architecture 113 during the medieval period means were found in europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron in this context known as pig iron using finery forges for all these processes charcoal was required as fuel 114 medieval blast furnaces were about 10 feet 30m tall and made of fireproof brick forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows 112 modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger with hearths fourteen meters in diameter that allow them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day but essentially operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times 114 in 1709 abraham darby i established a coke fired blast furnace to produce cast iron replacing charcoal although continuing to use blast furnaces the ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the industrial revolution toward the end of the 18th century cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes because it was cheaper carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron cast iron and steel until the 18th century 94 since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in 1778 this bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the industrial revolution following this iron was used in rails boats ships aqueducts and buildings as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines 114 railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress 115 and various languages eg french spanish italian and german refer to railways as iron road steel see also steelmaking steel with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery blacksmiths in luristan in western persia were making good steel by 1000bc 94 then improved versions wootz steel by india and damascus steel were developed around 300bc and ad500 respectively these methods were specialized and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s 116 new methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century in the industrial revolution new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel in the late 1850s henry bessemer invented a new steelmaking process involving blowing air through molten pig iron to produce mild steel this made steel much more economical thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities 117 foundations of modern chemistry in 1774 antoine lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the conservation of mass which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one 118 symbolic role iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore the greek poet hesiod s works and days lines 109201 lists different ages of man named after metals like gold silver bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity 119 the iron age was closely related with rome and in ovids metamorphoses the virtues in despair quit the earth and the depravity of man becomes universal and complete hard steel succeeded then ovid metamorphoses book i iron age line 160 ff an example of the importance of irons symbolic role may be found in the german campaign of 1813 frederick william iii commissioned then the first iron cross as military decoration berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815 when the prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding the inscription gold gab ich fr eisen i gave gold for iron was used as well in later war efforts 120 production of metallic iron industrial routes see also iron ore the production of iron or steel is a process consisting of two main stages in the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace alternatively it may be directly reduced in the second stage pig iron is converted to wrought iron steel or cast iron 121 for a few limited purposes when it is needed pure iron is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250c so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder 41 another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode 122 blast furnace processing main article blast furnace industrial iron production starts with iron ores principally hematite which has a nominal formula fe 2 o 3 and magnetite with the formula fe 3 o 4 these ores are reduced to the metal in a carbothermic reaction ie by treatment with carbon the conversion is typically conducted in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000c carbon is provided in the form of coke the process also contains a flux such as limestone which is used to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace the coke and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace while a massive blast of air heated to 900c about 4 tons per ton of iron 112 is forced into the furnace at the bottom 121 in the furnace the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce carbon monoxide 121 2 c o 2 2 co the carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore in the chemical equation below hematite to molten iron becoming carbon dioxide in the process 121 fe 2 o 3 3 co 2 fe 3 co 2 some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke 121 2 fe 2 o 3 3 c 4 fe 3 co 2 the flux present to melt impurities in the ore is principally limestone calcium carbonate and dolomite calcium-magnesium carbonate other specialized fluxes are used depending on the details of the ore in the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide also known as quicklime 121 caco 3 cao co 2 then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid slag 121 cao sio 2 casio 3 the slag melts in the heat of the furnace in the bottom of the furnace the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately the iron once cooled is called pig iron while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture 112 direct iron reduction owing to environmental concerns alternative methods of processing iron have been developed direct iron reduction reduces iron ore to a ferrous lump called sponge iron or direct iron that is suitable for steelmaking 112 two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process natural gas is partially oxidized with heat and a catalyst 112 2 ch 4 o 2 2 co 4 h 2 these gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace producing solid sponge iron 112 fe 2 o 3 co 2 h 2 2 fe co 2 2 h 2 o silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above 112 thermite main article thermite iron is a byproduct of burning a mixture of aluminum powder and rust powder fe 2 o 3 2 al 2 fe al 2 o 3 further processes main articles steelmaking and ironworks pig iron is not pure iron but has 45 carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur magnesium phosphorus and manganese as the carbon is the major impurity the iron pig iron becomes brittle and hard 121 removing the other impurities results in cast iron which is used to cast articles in foundries such as stoves pipes radiators lamp-posts and rails 121 alternatively pig iron may be made into steel with up to about 2 carbon or wrought iron commercially pure iron various processes have been used for this including finery forges puddling furnaces bessemer converters open hearth furnaces basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces in all cases the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon together with other impurities on the other hand other metals may be added to make alloy steels 114 annealing involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700800c for several hours and then gradual cooling it makes the steel softer and more workable 123 applications metallurgical see also steel iron is the most widely used of all the metals accounting for over 90 of worldwide metal production its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools automobiles the hulls of large ships and structural components for buildings since pure iron is quite soft it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel 124 iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon no more than 0.021 by mass at 910c 125 austenite iron is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon as much as 2.04 by mass at 1146c this form of iron is used in the type of stainless steel used for making cutlery and hospital and food-service equipment 13 commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives pig iron has 3545 carbon 126 and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur silicon and phosphorus pig iron is not a saleable product but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel the reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties such as sulfur and phosphorus yields cast iron containing 24 carbon 16 silicon and small amounts of manganese 121 pig iron has a melting point in the range of 14201470k which is lower than either of its two main components and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together 14 its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy 11 white cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite or iron carbide fe 3 c 11 this hard brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons rendering them hard but unresistant to shock the broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide a very pale silvery shiny material hence the appellation cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8 carbon slowly below 723c to room temperature results in separate alternating layers of cementite and iron which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance rapid cooling on the other hand does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite the steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite the end product below 0.8 carbon content is a pearlite-fe mixture and that above 0.8 carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture 11 in gray iron the carbon exists as separate fine flakes of graphite and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material 127 a newer variant of gray iron referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids or nodules reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material 127 wrought iron contains less than 0.25 carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic 126 it is a tough malleable product but not as fusible as pig iron if honed to an edge it loses it quickly wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within the metal wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel it has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional wrought iron products and blacksmithing mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron but is cheaper and more widely available carbon steel contains 2.0 carbon or less 129 with small amounts of manganese sulfur phosphorus and silicon alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals such as chromium vanadium molybdenum nickel tungsten etc their alloy content raises their cost and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses one common alloy steel though is stainless steel recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels also termed hsla or high-strength low alloy steels containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost 129 130 131 apart from traditional applications iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation although it is lighter than another traditional protection material lead it is much stronger mechanically the attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph 132 the main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron and most of its alloys suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way a cost amounting to over 1 of the worlds economy 133 painting galvanization passivation plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection the mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows 133 cathode 3 o 2 6 h 2 o 12 e 12 oh anode 4 fe 4 fe 2 8 e 4 fe 2 4 fe 3 4 e overall 4 fe 3 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 fe 3 12 oh 4 feoh 3 or 4 feooh 4 h 2 o the electrolyte is usually ironii sulfate in urban areas formed when atmospheric sulfur dioxide attacks iron and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas 133 iron compounds although the dominant use of iron is in metallurgy iron compounds are also pervasive in industry iron catalysts are traditionally used in the haber-bosch process for the production of ammonia and the fischer-tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants 134 powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline 135 ironiii chloride finds use in water purification and sewage treatment in the dyeing of cloth as a coloring agent in paints as an additive in animal feed and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed circuit boards 136 it can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries 137 ironii sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds it is also used to reduce chromate in cement it is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia ironiii sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water ironii chloride is used as a reducing flocculating agent in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis 136 biological and pathological role main article human iron metabolism iron is required for life 5 138 139 the iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation iron-containing proteins participate in transport storage and used of oxygen 5 iron proteins are involved in the transfer of electrons 140 examples of iron-containing proteins in higher organisms include hemoglobin cytochrome see high-valent iron and catalase 5 141 the average adult human contains about 0.005 body weight of iron or about four grams of which three quarters is in hemoglobin a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day 140 because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content 142 biochemistry iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral ph thus these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron 5 in particular bacteria have evolved very high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores 143 144 145 after uptake in human cells iron storage is precisely regulated 5 146 a major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells 5 147 transferrin contains fe 3 in the middle of a distorted octahedron bonded to one nitrogen three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the fe 3 ion it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up fe 3 ions even from the most stable complexes at the bone marrow transferrin is reduced from fe 3 and fe 2 and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin 140 the most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds biological iron molecules are the heme proteins examples are hemoglobin myoglobin and cytochrome p450 5 these compounds participate in transporting gases building enzymes and transferring electrons 140 metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin 140 many enzymes vital to life contain iron such as catalase 148 lipoxygenases 149 and ire-bp 150 hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose generating energy 5 here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide produced when glucose is oxidized which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin predominantly as bicarbonate anions back to the lungs where it is exhaled 140 in hemoglobin the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to 140 when hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen and is then called deoxyhemoglobin the fe 2 ion at the center of the heme group in the hydrophobic protein interior is in a high-spin configuration it is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring which bends instead into a dome with the fe 2 ion about 55picometers above it in this configuration the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue 140 when deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it this results in the fe 2 ion switching to a low-spin configuration resulting in a 20 decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring which becomes planar 140 additionally this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule resulting in a feoo bond angle of around 120 that avoids the formation of feofe or feo 2 fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer the oxidation of fe 2 to fe 3 and the destruction of hemoglobin this results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity thus when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen its affinity for more oxygen increases and vice versa 140 myoglobin on the other hand contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur thus while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue 140 as described by the bohr effect named after christian bohr the father of niels bohr the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide 140 carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen but with much more strength so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin this effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a 140 the cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen the sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen with the exception of cytochrome a which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide 140 here the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the 2 and 3 oxidation states since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate cytochrome a is slightly distinct as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane binds directly to oxygen and transports protons as well as electrons as follows 140 4 cytc 2 o 2 8h inside 4 cytc 3 2 h 2 o 4h outside although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important being involved in electron transfer which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the 2 or 3 oxidation states these have one two four or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms because of this tetrahedral coordination they always have high-spin iron the simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins which have multiple iron atoms transferrin does not belong to either of these classes 140 the ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles based on synthetic replicas the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times tensile strength 58 times and toughness 92 times the amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times 152 health and diet iron is pervasive but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat oysters lentils beans poultry fish leaf vegetables watercress tofu chickpeas black-eyed peas and blackstrap molasses 5 bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron 5 153 iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as ironii fumarate although ironii sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well 136 elemental iron or reduced iron despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency relative to iron sulfate 154 is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids 155 and is also available for use as a common iron supplement glycine the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements 156 dietary recommendations the us institute of medicine iom updated estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances rdas for iron in 2001 5 the current ear for iron for women ages 1418 is 79mgday 8.1 for ages 1950 and 5.0 thereafter post menopause for men the ear is 60mgday for ages 19 and up the rda is 150mgday for women ages 1518 18.0 for 1950 and 8.0 thereafter for men 80mgday for ages 19 and up rdas are higher than ears so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements rda for pregnancy is 27mgday and for lactation 9mgday 5 for children ages 13 years 7mgday 10 for ages 48 and 8 for ages 913 as for safety the iom also sets tolerable upper intake levels uls for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of iron the ul is set at 45mgday collectively the ears rdas and uls are referred to as dietary reference intakes 157 the european food safety authority efsa refers to the collective set of information as dietary reference values with population reference intake pri instead of rda and average requirement instead of ear ai and ul defined the same as in united states for women the pri is 13mgday ages 1517 years 16mgday for women ages 18 and up who are premenopausal and 11mgday postmenopausal for pregnancy and lactation 16mgday for men the pri is 11mgday ages 15 and older for children ages 1 to 14 the pri increases from 7 to 11mgday the pris are higher than the us rdas with the exception of pregnancy 158 the efsa reviewed the same safety question did not establish a ul 159 infants may require iron supplements if they are bottle-fed cows milk 160 frequent blood donors are at risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake 161 for us food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value dv for iron labeling purposes 100 of the daily value was 18mg and as of may 27 2016 remained unchanged at 18mg 162 a table of all of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake the original deadline to be in compliance was july 28 2018 but on september 29 2017 the us food and drug administration released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to january 1 2020 for large companies and january 1 2021 for small companies 163 deficiency main article iron deficiency iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world 5 164 165 166 when loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake a state of latent iron deficiency occurs which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin 167 children pre-menopausal women women of child-bearing age and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat complications during pregnancy and delayed growth in infants and children 168 excess main article iron overload iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake 170 regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the hla-h gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals 171 in these people excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders known medically as hemochromatosis 5 many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload and are not aware of a family history of the problem for this reason people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8 of all metabolic diseases of caucasians 172 overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the blood high blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage dna proteins lipids and other cellular components iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels iron typically damages cells in the heart liver and elsewhere causing adverse effects that include coma metabolic acidosis shock liver failure coagulopathy adult respiratory distress syndrome long-term organ damage and even death 173 humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose 174 overconsumption of iron often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six 174 the dietary reference intake dri sets the tolerable upper intake level ul for adults at 45mgday for children under fourteen years old the ul is 40mgday 175 the medical management of iron toxicity is complicated and can include use of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body 173 176 177 cancer the role of iron in cancer defense can be described as a double-edged sword because of its pervasive presence in non-pathological processes 178 people having chemotherapy may develop iron deficiency and anemia for which intravenous iron therapy is used to restore iron levels 179 iron overload which may occur from high consumption of red meat 5 may initiate tumor growth and increase susceptibility to cancer onset 179 particularly for colorectal cancer 5
