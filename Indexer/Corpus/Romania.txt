with the fascist and chauvinistic iron guard and the authoritarian tendencies of king carol ii 77 during world war ii romania tried again to remain neutral but on 28 june 1940 it received a soviet ultimatum with an implied threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance 78 again foreign powers created heavy pressure on romania by means of the molotovribbentrop pact of non-aggression from 23 august 1939 as a result of it the romanian government and the army were forced to retreat from bessarabia as well as from northern bukovina in order to avoid war with the soviet union 79 the king was

holocaust in romania 87 during the antonescu fascist regime romanian contribution to operation barbarossa was enormous with the romanian army of over 1.2 million men in the summer of 1941 fighting in numbers second only to nazi germany 88 romania was the main source of oil for the third reich 89 and thus became the target of intense bombing by the allies growing discontent among the population eventually peaked in august 1944 with king michaels coup and the country switched sides to join the allies it is estimated that the coup shortened the war by as much as six months 90 even though the romanian army had suffered 170000 casualties after switching sides 91 romanias role in the defeat of nazi germany was not recognized by the paris peace conference of 1947 92 as the soviet union annexed bessarabia and other territories corresponding roughly to present-day republic of moldova and bulgaria retained southern dobruja but romania did regain northern transylvania from hungary communism main article socialist republic of romania during the soviet occupation of romania the communist dominated government called for new elections in 1946 which were fraudulently won with a

become romanias first communist leader in 1947 he and others forced king michael i to abdicate and leave the country and proclaimed romania a peoples republic 95 96 romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the ussr until the late 1950s during this period romanias vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed soviet-romanian companies sovroms set up for unilateral exploitative purposes 97 98 99 in 1948 the state began to nationalize private firms and to collectivize agriculture 100 until the early 1960s the government severely curtailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the securitate the romanian secret police during this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous enemies of the state and parasite elements were targeted for different forms of punishment such as deportation internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons sometimes for life as well as extrajudicial killing 101 nevertheless anti-communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the eastern bloc 102 a 2006 commission estimated the number of direct victims of the communist repression at two million people 103 in 1965 nicolae ceauescu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the soviet union thus communist romania was the only warsaw pact country who refused to participate at the soviet-led 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia ceauescu even publicly condemned the action as a big mistake and a serious danger to peace in europe and to the fate of communism in the world 104 it was also the only communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with israel after 1967s six-day war and established diplomatic relations with west germany the same year 105 at the same time close ties with the arab countries and the plo allowed romania to play a key role in the israel egypt and israelplo peace talks 106 as romanias foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 from us3 billion to 10billion 107 the influence of international financial organizations such as the imf and the world bank grew gradually conflicting with ceauescus autocratic rule the latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy the process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of romania in 1989 at the same time ceauescu greatly extended the authority of the securitate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictators popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution together with his wife in the violent romanian revolution of december 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured the charges for which they were executed were among others genocide by starvation contemporary period main article history of romania since 1989 after the 1989 revolution the national salvation front nsf led by ion iliescu took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures 108 109 in april 1990 a sit-in protest contesting the results of that years legislative elections and accusing the nsf including iliescu of being made up of former communists and members of the securitate rapidly grew to become what was called the golaniad the peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by iliescu this episode has been documented widely by both local 110 and foreign media 111 and is remembered as the june 1990 mineriad 112 113 the subsequent disintegration of the front produced several political parties including most notably the social democratic party and the democratic party the former governed romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with ion iliescu as head of state since then there have been several other democratic changes of government in 1996 emil constantinescu was elected president in 2000 iliescu returned to power while traian bsescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009 114 in november 2014 sibiu mayor klaus iohannis was elected president unexpectedly defeating prime minister victor ponta who had been in the lead in the opinion polls this surprise victory is attributed by many to the romanian diaspora of which almost 50 percent voted for iohannis in the first tour compared to 16 percent for ponta 115 former president traian bsescu 20042014 has twice been impeached by the parliament of romania in 2007 and in 2012 the second time on the background of street protest earlier in the year both times a popular referendum was called the second time in the romanian presidential impeachment referendum 2012 more than 7 million voters 88 of participants 116 voted to oust bsescu compared to the 5.2 million voters who initially supported him in the romanian presidential election 2009 however the constitutional court of romania in a split decision invalided the outcome of the referendum stating the turnout 46.24 by official statistics was too low 117 supporters of bsescu were called upon by him and his former party to not participate in the referendum so that it would be invalidated due to insufficient turnout 118 the post-1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the communist period have been closed mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post-1989 regimes 119 according to valentin mndrescu a romanian-language editor of the voice of russia the national petroleum company petrom has been sold to foreigners for significantly undervalued prices 120 121 furthermore other major privatizations like that of banca comercial a romniei are criticized by opponents for being detrimental to the romanian people 122 post-1989 regimes are also criticized for allowing foreign exploitations of mineral rare metals and gold reserves at roia montan 123 as well as for permitting american multinational energy giant chevron to prospect for shale gas using the hydraulic fracking technique which has been claimed to pollute the vast underground freshwater reserves in the affected areas both these actions have led to significant protests by the population in

end of the cold war romania developed closer ties with western europe and the united states eventually joining nato in 2004 and hosting the 2008 summit in bucharest 125 the country applied in june

the highest economic growth rates in europe and has been referred at times as the tiger of eastern europe 127 this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced internal poverty and established a functional democratic state 128 129 however romanias development suffered a major setback during the late-2000s recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and budget deficit in 2009 130 this led to romania borrowing from the international monetary fund 131 the worsening economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012 132 romania still faces problems related to infrastructure 133 medical services 134 education 135 and corruption 136 near the end of 2013 the economist reported romania again enjoying booming economic growth at 4.1 that year with wages rising fast and a lower unemployment than in britain economic growth accelerated in the midst of government liberalisations in opening up new sectors to competition and investmentmost notably energy and telecoms 137 in 2016 the human development index ranked romania as a nation of very high human development 138 following the experience of economic instability throughout the 1990s and the implementation of a free travel agreement with the eu a great number of romanians emigrated to western europe and north america with particularly large communities in italy and spain in 2008 the romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over twomillion people 139 the cyclical nature of the world economy and economic disparities between romania and advanced european economies has fueled further emigration from the country the emigration has caused social changes in romania whereby the parents would leave for western europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children who have been left behind some children are left to be taken care of by grandparents and relatives and some live alone if the parents deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient 140 subsequently the youth began to be called euro-orphans 141 geography and climate main article geography of romania with an area of 238391 square kilometres
