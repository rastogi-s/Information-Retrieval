joseph von fraunhofer wikipedia joseph von fraunhofer joseph ritter von fraunhofer 6 march 1787 7 june 1826 was a bavarian physicist and optical lens manufacturer he made optical glass and achromatic telescope objective lenses invented the spectroscope and developed diffraction grating he also discovered and studied the dark absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun now known as fraunhofer lines biography edit joseph fraunhofer was born in straubing in the electorate of bavaria to franz xaver fraunhofer and maria anna frohlich 1 he was orphaned at the age of 11 and started working as an apprentice to a harsh glassmaker named philipp anton weichelsberger citation needed in 1801 the workshop in which he was working collapsed and he was buried in the rubble the rescue operation was led by prince-elector maximilian joseph the prince entered fraunhofers life providing him with books and forcing his employer to allow the young fraunhofer time to study citation needed joseph utzschneider was also at the site of the disaster and would also become a benefactor to fraunhofer with the money given to him by the prince upon his rescue and the support he received from utzschneider fraunhofer was able to continue his education alongside his practical training 2 in 1806 utzschneider and georg von reichenbach brought fraunhofer into their institute at benediktbeuern a secularised benedictine monastery devoted to glassmaking there he discovered how to make the fine optical glass and invented precise methods for measuring optical dispersion it was at the institute that fraunhofer met pierre louis guinand a swiss glass technician who instructed fraunhofer in glassmaking at utzschneiders behest 3 by 1809 the mechanical part of the optical institute was chiefly under fraunhofers direction and fraunhofer became one of the members of the firm that same year 4 in 1814 guinand left the firm as did reichenbach guinad would later became a partner with fraunhofer in the firm 3 and the name was changed to utzschneider-und-fraunhofer during 1818 fraunhofer became the director of the optical institute due to the fine optical instruments developed by fraunhofer bavaria overtook england as the center of the optics industry even the likes of michael faraday were unable to produce glass that could rival fraunhofer citation needed his illustrious career eventually earned him an honorary doctorate from the university of erlangen in 1822 in 1824 fraunhofer was appointed an knight of the order of merit of the bavarian crown by king maximilian i through which he was raised into personal nobility with the title ritter von ie knight the same year he was also made an honorary citizen of munich like many glassmakers of his era he was poisoned by heavy metal vapors resulting in his premature death fraunhofer died in 1826 at the age of 39 his most valuable glassmaking recipes are thought to have gone to the grave with him citation needed invention and scientific research edit one of the most difficult operations of practical optics during the time period of fraunhofers life was accurately polishing the spherical surfaces of large object glasses fraunhofer invented the machine which which rendered the surface more accurately than traditional grinding he also invented other grinding and polishing machines and introduced many improvements into the manufacture of the different kinds of glass used for optical instruments which he always found to be injured by flaws and irregularities of various sorts 4 in 1811 he constructed a new kind of furnace and during his second melting session when he melted a large quantity of glass he found that he could produce flint glass which when taken from the bottom of a vessel containing roughly 224 pounds of glass had the same refractive power as glass taken from the surface he found that the english crown glass and the german table glass both contained defects which tended to cause irregular refraction in the thicker and larger glasses there would be even more of such defects so that in larger telescopes this kind of glass would not be fit for object glasses fraunhofer therefore made his own crown glass 4 it was thought that the accurate determination of power for a given medium to refract rays of light and separate the different colors which they contain was impeded due to the colors of the spectrum having no precise limits making it difficult to accurately measure the angle of refraction to debunk this fraunhofer performed a series of experiments for the purpose of producing homogeneous light artificially and unable to effect his object in a direct way he did so by means of lamps and prisms 4 thus in 1814 fraunhofer invented the spectroscope in the course of his experiments he discovered a bright fixed line which appears in the orange color of the spectrum when it is produced by the light of fire this line enabled him afterward to determine the absolute power of refraction in different substances experiments to ascertain whether the solar spectrum contained the same bright line in orange as the line produced by the orange of fire light led him to the discovery of 574 dark fixed lines in the solar spectrum today millions of such fixed absorption lines are now known 4 5 these dark fixed lines were later shown to be atomic absorption lines as explained by kirchhoff and bunsen in 1859 6 these lines are still called fraunhofer lines in his honor his discovery had gone far beyond the half-dozen apparent divisions in the solar spectrum that had previously been noted by wollaston in 1802 7 fraunhofer also developed a diffraction grating in 1821 which occurred after james gregory discovered the principles of diffraction grating and after american astronomer david rittenhouse invented the first man-made diffraction grating in 1785 8 9 fraunhofer found out that the spectra of sirius and other first-magnitude stars differed from the sun and from each other thus founding stellar spectroscopy 10 ultimately however his primary passion was still practical optics once noting that in all my experiments i could owing to lack of time pay attention to only those matters which appeared to have a bearing upon practical optics 11 telescopes and optical instruments edit fraunhofer produced various optical instruments for his firm 3 this included the fraunhofer dorpat refractor used by struve delivered 1824 to dorpat observatory and the bessel heliometer delivered posthumously which were both used to collect data for stellar parallax the firms successor merz und mahler made a telescope for the new berlin observatory which confirmed the existence of the major planet neptune possibly the last telescope objective made by fraunhofer was supplied for a transit telescope at the city observatory edinburgh 12 the telescope itself being completed by repsold of hamburg after fraunhofers death works edit prismatic and diffraction
