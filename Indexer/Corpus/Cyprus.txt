to some of the oldest water wells in the world 9 cyprus was settled by mycenaean greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium bc as a strategic location in the middle east it was subsequently occupied by several major powers including the empires of the assyrians egyptians and persians from whom the island was seized in 333 bc by alexander the great subsequent rule by ptolemaic egypt the classical and eastern roman empire arab caliphates for a short period the french lusignan dynasty and the venetians was followed by over three centuries of ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 de jure until 1914 10 cyprus was placed under british administration based on the cyprus convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by britain in 1914 while turkish cypriots made up 18 of the population the partition of cyprus and creation of a turkish state in the north became a policy of turkish cypriot leaders and turkey in the 1950s turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of cyprus to turkey as cyprus was considered an extension of anatolia by them while since the 19th century 11 12 the majority greek cypriot population and its orthodox church had been pursuing union with greece which became a greek national policy in the 1950s 13 following nationalist violence in the 1950s cyprus was granted independence in 1960 14 in 1963 the 11-year intercommunal violence between greek cypriots and

cypriot nationalists 17 18 and elements of the greek military junta 19 in an attempt at enosis the incorporation of cyprus into greece this action precipitated the turkish invasion of cyprus on 20

turkish cypriots 23 a separate turkish cypriot state in the north was established by unilateral declaration in 1983 the move was widely condemned by the international community with turkey alone recognizing the new state these events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute the republic of cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the entire island including its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone with the exception of the sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia which remain under british control according to the london and zrich agreements however the republic of cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts the area under the effective control of the republic located in the south and west and comprising about 59 of the islands area and the north 24 administered by the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus covering about 36 of the islands area another nearly 4 of the islands area is covered by the un buffer zone the international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the republic of cyprus occupied by turkish forces 25 26 27 28 29 the occupation is viewed as illegal under

that it has roots in the sumerian word for copper zubar or for bronze kubar from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island 40 through overseas trade the island has given its name to the

significantly 45 the remarkably well-preserved neolithic village of khirokitia is a unesco world heritage site dating to approximately 6800 bc 46 during the late bronze age the island experienced two waves of greek settlement 47 the first wave consisted of mycenaean greek traders who started visiting cyprus around 1400 bc 48 49 a major wave of greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the bronze age collapse of mycenaean greece from 1100 to 1050bc with the islands predominantly greek character dating from this period 49 50 cyprus occupies an important role in greek mythology being the birthplace of aphrodite and adonis and home to king cinyras teucer and pygmalion 51 beginning in the 8th centurybc phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of cyprus near present-day larnaca and salamis 49 cyprus is at a strategic location in the middle east 52 53 54 it was ruled by assyria for a century starting in 708bc before a brief spell under egyptian rule and eventually persian rule in 545bc 49 the cypriots led by onesilus king of salamis joined their fellow greeks in the ionian cities during the unsuccessful ionian revolt in 499bc against the achaemenid empire the revolt was suppressed but cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the greek world 49 the island was conquered by alexander the great in 333bc following his death and the subsequent division of his empire and wars among his successors cyprus became part of the hellenistic empire of ptolemaic egypt it was during this period that the island was fully hellenized in 58bc cyprus was acquired by the roman republic 49 middle ages main articles cyprus in the middle ages and kingdom of cyprus when the roman empire was divided into eastern and western parts in 395 cyprus became part of the east roman or byzantine empire and would remain so until the crusades some 800 years later under byzantine rule the greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong hellenistic-christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the greek cypriot community 49 beginning in 649 cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched by muslim armies from the levant which continued for the next 300 years 49 many were quick piratical raids but others were large-scale attacks in which many cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed 49 there are no byzantine churches which survive from this period thousands of people were killed and many cities such as salamis were destroyed and never rebuilt 49 byzantine rule was restored in 965 when emperor nikephoros ii phokas scored decisive victories on land and sea 49 in 1191 during the third crusade richard i of england captured the island from isaac komnenos of cyprus 55 he used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the saracens a year later richard sold the island to the knights templar who following a bloody revolt in turn sold it to guy of lusignan his brother and successor aimery was recognised as king of cyprus by henry vi holy roman emperor 49 following the death in 1473 of james ii the last

frequently raided cyprus in 1539 the ottomans destroyed limassol and so fearing the worst the venetians also fortified famagusta and kyrenia 49 although the lusignan french aristocracy remained the dominant social class in cyprus throughout the medieval period the former assumption that greeks were treated only as serfs on the island 49 is no longer considered by academics to be accurate it is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of greek cypriots elevated to the upper classes a growing greek middle ranks 56 and the lusignan royal household even marrying greeks this included king john ii of cyprus who married helena palaiologina 57 cyprus under the ottoman empire main article ottoman cyprus in 1570 a full-scale ottoman assault with 60000 troops brought the island under ottoman control despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of nicosia and famagusta ottoman forces capturing cyprus massacred many greek and armenian christian inhabitants 58 the previous latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a muslim community 59 soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and turkish peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from anatolia 60 this new community also included banished anatolian tribes undesirable persons and members of various troublesome muslim sects as well as a number of new converts on the island 61 the ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to cyprus under which non-muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities in a reversal from the days of latin rule the head of the church of cyprus was invested as leader of the greek cypriot population and acted as mediator between christian greek cypriots and the ottoman authorities this status ensured that the church of cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the roman catholic church 62 ottoman rule of cyprus was at times indifferent at times oppressive depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials and the island began over 250 years of economic decline 63 the ratio of muslims to christians fluctuated throughout the period of ottoman domination in 177778 47000 muslims constituted a majority over the islands 37000 christians 64 by 1872 the population of the island had risen to 144000 comprising 44000 muslims and 100000 christians 65 the muslim population included numerous crypto-christians 66 including the linobambaki a crypto-catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the catholic community by the ottoman authorities 66 67 this community would assimilate into the turkish cypriot community during british rule 68 as soon as the greek war of independence broke out in 1821 several greek cypriots left for greece to join the greek forces in response the ottoman governor of cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent greek cypriots including the archbishop of cyprus kyprianos and four other bishops 69 in 1828 modern greeces first president ioannis kapodistrias called for union of cyprus with greece and numerous minor uprisings took place 70 reaction to ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both greek and turkish cypriots although none were successful after centuries of neglect by the turks the unrelenting poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled greek nationalism and by the 20th century idea of enosis or union with newly independent greece was firmly rooted among greek cypriots 63 numeracy under the ottoman rule numeracy school enrollment and literacy rates were all low in some countries these low levels of human capital level persisted sometime after ottoman rule ended greece and cyprus were no exception they faced the same issue of paths taken under ottoman educational policies in these two countries greece and cyprus numeracy increased rapidly during the twentieth century 71 cyprus under the british empire main article modern history of cyprus in the aftermath of the russo-turkish war 18771878 and the congress of berlin cyprus was leased to the british empire which de facto took over its administration in 1878 though in terms of sovereignty cyprus remained a de jure ottoman territory until 5 november 1914 together with egypt and sudan 10 in exchange for guarantees that britain would use the island as a base to protect the ottoman empire against possible russian aggression 49 the island would serve britain as a key military base for its colonial routes by 1906 when the famagusta harbour was completed cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the suez canal the crucial main route to india which was then britains most important overseas possession following the outbreak of the first world war and the decision of the ottoman empire to join the war on the side of the central powers on 5 november 1914 the british empire formally annexed cyprus and declared the ottoman khedivate of egypt and sudan a sultanate and british protectorate 10 49 in 1915 britain offered cyprus to greece ruled by king constantine i of greece on condition that greece join the war on the side of the british the offer was declined in 1923 under the treaty of lausanne the nascent turkish republic relinquished any claim to cyprus 72 and in 1925 it was declared a british crown colony 49 many greek and turkish cypriots fought in the british army during both world wars 73 not in citation given during the second world war many enlisted in the cyprus regiment the greek cypriot population meanwhile had become hopeful that the british administration would lead to enosis the idea of enosis was historically part of the megali idea a greater political ambition of a greek state encompassing the territories with greek inhabitants in the former ottoman empire including cyprus and asia minor with a capital in constantinople and was actively pursued by the cypriot orthodox church which had its members educated in greece these religious officials together with greek military officers and professionals some of whom still pursued the megali idea would later found the guerrilla organisation ethniki organosis kyprion agoniston or national organisation of cypriot fighters eoka 74 75 the greek cypriots viewed the island as historically greek and believed that union with greece was a natural right 76 in the 1950s the pursuit of enosis became a part of the greek national policy 77 initially the turkish cypriots favoured the continuation of the british rule 78 however they were alarmed by the greek cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of crete with greece which led to the exodus of cretan turks as a precedent to be avoided 79 80 and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of eoka 81 the turkish cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from greek cypriots 76 meanwhile in the 1950s turkish leader menderes considered cyprus an extension of anatolia rejected the partition of cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to turkey nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that cyprus is turkish and the ruling party declared cyprus to be a part of the turkish homeland that was vital to its security upon realising the fact that the turkish cypriot population was only 20 of the islanders made annexation unfeasible the national policy was changed to favour partition the slogan partition or death was frequently used in turkish cypriot and turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s although after the zrich and london conferences turkey seemed to accept the existence of the cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island the goal of the turkish and turkish cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent turkish state in the northern part of the island 82 83 in january 1950 the church of cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no turkish cypriot participation 84 where 96 of the participating greek cypriots voted in favour of enosis 85 86 87 the greeks were 80.2 of the total island s population at the time census 1946 restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the british administration but eventually rejected in 1955 the eoka organisation was founded seeking union with greece through armed struggle at the same time the turkish resistance organisation tmt calling for taksim or partition was established by the turkish cypriots as a counterweight 88 the british had also adopted at the time a policy of divide and rule woodhouse who a british official in cyprus revealed that then british foreign secretary harold macmillan urged the britons in cyprus to stir up the turks in order to neutralise greek agitation citation needed british officials also tolerated the creation of the turkish underground organisation tmt the secretary of state for the colonies in a letter dated 15 july 1958 had advised the governor of cyprus not to act against tmt despite its illegal actions so as not to harm british relations with the turkish government 83 independence and inter-communal violence main

allocated by ethnic quotas giving the minority turkish cypriots a permanent veto 30 in parliament and administration and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights however the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides and nationalist militants started training again with the military support of greece and turkey respectively the greek cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to turkish cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the akritas plan which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of greek cypriots persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating turkish cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan 90 tensions were heightened when cypriot president archbishop makarios iii called for constitutional changes which were rejected by turkey 15 and opposed by turkish cypriots 90 intercommunal violence erupted on 21 december 1963 when two turkish cypriots were killed at an incident involving the greek cypriot police the violence resulted in the death of 364 turkish and 174 greek cypriots 91 destruction of 109 turkish cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 2500030000 turkish cypriots the crisis resulted in the end of the turkish cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy 15 the nature of this event is still controversial in some areas greek cypriots prevented turkish cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings while some turkish cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the turkish cypriot administration 92 turkish cypriots started living in enclaves the republics structure was changed unilaterally by makarios and nicosia was divided by the green line with the deployment of unficyp troops 15 in 1964 turkey threatened to invade cyprus 93 in response to the continuing cypriot intercommunal violence but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the us president lyndon b johnson on 5 june warning that the us would not stand beside turkey in case of a consequential soviet invasion of turkish territory 94 meanwhile by 1964 enosis was a greek policy that could not be abandoned makarios and the greek prime minister georgios papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and king constantine wished cyprus a speedy union with the mother country greece dispatched 10000 troops to cyprus to counter a possible turkish invasion 95 1974 coup turkish invasion and division main

invaded the island citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 treaty of guarantee this justification has been rejected by the united nations and the international community 105 the turkish air force began bombing greek positions in cyprus and hundreds of paratroopers were dropped in the area between nicosia and kyrenia where well-armed turkish cypriot enclaves had been long-established while off the kyrenia coast turkish troop ships landed 6000 men as well as tanks trucks and armoured vehicles 106 107 three days later when a ceasefire had been agreed 108 turkey had landed 30000 troops on the island and captured kyrenia the corridor linking kyrenia to nicosia and the turkish cypriot quarter of nicosia itself 108 the junta in athens and then the sampson regime in cyprus fell from power in nicosia glafkos clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored removing the pretext for the turkish invasion 108 but after the peace negotiations in geneva the turkish government reinforced their kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 august 109 the invasion resulted in the seizure of morphou karpass famagusta and the mesaoria international pressure led to a ceasefire and by then 36 of the island had been taken over by the turks and 180000 greek cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north 110 at the same time around 50000 turkish cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the turkish forces and settled in the properties of the displaced greek cypriots among a variety of sanctions against

secretary general kofi annan the plan was put to a referendum in both northern cyprus and the republic of cyprus 65 of turkish cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74 greek cypriots voted against

water supply cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water the country relies heavily on rain to provide household water but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased 135 between 2001 and 2004 exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up with supply exceeding demand allowing total storage in the islands reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005 however since then demand has increased annually a result of local population growth foreigners moving to cyprus and the number of visiting tourists while supply has fallen as a result
