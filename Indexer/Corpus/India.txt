etymology main article names for india the name india is derived from indus which originates from the old persian word hindu 20 the latter term stems from the sanskrit word sindhu which was the historical local appellation for the indus river 21 the ancient greeks referred to the indians as indoi which translates as the people of the indus 22 the geographical term bharat bhrat pronounced bart listen which is recognised by the constitution of india as an official name for the country 23 is used by many indian languages in its variations it is a modernisation of the historical name bharatavarsha which traditionally referred to the indian subcontinent and gained increasing currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for india 24 25 scholars believe it to be named after the vedic tribe of bhratas in the second millennium bce 26 it is also traditionally associated with the rule of the legendary emperor bharata 27 the hindu text skanda purana states that the region was named bharat after bharata chakravartin gaarjya literally peoples state is the sanskrit hindi term for republic dating back to ancient times 28 29 30 hindustan ndstan listen is a persian name for india dating back to the 3rd century bce it was introduced into india by the mughals and widely used since then its meaning varied referring to a region that encompassed northern india and pakistan or india in its entirety 24 25 31 currently the name may refer to either the northern part of india or the entire country 31 history main articles history of india and history of the republic of india ancient india the earliest authenticated human remains in south asia date to about 30000 years ago 32 nearly contemporaneous mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the indian subcontinent including at the bhimbetka rock shelters in madhya pradesh 33 around 7000 bce one of the first known neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in mehrgarh and other sites in the subcontinent 34 these gradually developed into the indus valley civilisation 35 the first urban culture in south asia 36 it flourished during 25001900bce in northeast afghanistan to pakistan and northwest india 37 centred around cities such as mohenjo-daro harappa dholavira and kalibangan and relying on varied forms of subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade 36 during the period 2000500 bce in terms of culture many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic to the iron age 38 the vedas the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism 39 were composed during this period 40 and historians have analysed these to posit a vedic culture in the punjab region and the upper gangetic plain 38 most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of indo-aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west 39 the caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure arose during this period 41 on the deccan plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation 38 in south india a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period 42 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions 42 in the late vedic period around the 6th century bce the small states and chiefdoms of the ganges plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas 43 44 the emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar mahavira 45 buddhism based on the teachings of gautama buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in india 46 47 48 in an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal 49 and both established long-lasting monastic traditions politically by the 3rd century bce the kingdom of magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the mauryan empire 50 the empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas 51 52 the mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the buddhist dhamma 53 54 the sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that between 200 bce and 200 ce the southern peninsula was being ruled by the cheras the cholas and the pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and south-east asia 55 56 in north india hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women 57 50 by the 4th and 5th centuries the gupta empire had created in the greater ganges plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later indian kingdoms 58 59 under the guptas a renewed hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself 60 the renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite 59 classical sanskrit literature flowered as well and indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances 59 medieval india the indian early medieval age 600 ce to 1200 ce is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity 61 when harsha of kannauj who ruled much of the indo-gangetic plain from 606 to 647 ce attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the chalukya ruler of the deccan 62 when his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the pala king of bengal 62 when the chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the pandyas and the cholas from still farther south 62 no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region 61 during this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes 63 the caste system consequently began to show regional differences 63 in the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the tamil language 64 they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent 64 indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well 65 temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another urbanisation 65 by the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in south-east asia as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day myanmar thailand laos cambodia vietnam philippines malaysia and java 66 indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission south-east asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their languages 66 after the 10th century muslim central asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran south asias north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in 1206 67 the sultanate was to control much of north india and to make many forays into south india although at first disruptive for the indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-muslim subject population to its own laws and customs 68 69 by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic indo-islamic culture in the north 70 71 the sultanates raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara empire 72 embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular india 73 and was to influence south indian society for long afterwards 72 early modern india in the early 16th century northern india being then under mainly muslim rulers 74 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian warriors 75 the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices 76 77 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites 78 leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule 79 eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity especially under akbar the mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status 78 the mughal states economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture 80 and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency 81 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets 79 the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in indias economic expansion 79 resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture 82 newly coherent social groups in northern and western india such as the marathas the rajputs and the sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience 83 expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern india 83 as the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs 84 by the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of european trading companies including the english east india company had established coastal outposts 85 86 the east india companys control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other european companies 87 85 88 89 its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of india by the 1820s 90 india was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the british empire with raw materials and many historians consider this to be the onset of indias colonial period 85 by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and effectively having been made an arm of british administration the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education social reform and culture 91 modern india historians consider indias modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 the appointment in 1848 of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state these included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens technological changesamong them railways canals and the telegraphwere introduced not long after their introduction in europe 92 93 94 95 however disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the indian rebellion of 1857 fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive british-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company rule 96 97 although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the east india company and to the direct administration of india by the british government proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited british-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest 98 99 in the decades following public life gradually emerged all over india leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in 1885 100 101 102 103 the rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacksmany small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets 104 there was an increase in the number of large-scale famines 105 and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for indians 106 there were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption 107 the railway network provided critical famine relief 108 notably reduced the cost of moving goods 108 and helped nascent indian-owned industry 107 after world war i in which approximately one million indians served 109 a new period began it was marked by british reforms but also repressive legislations by more strident indian calls for self-rule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation of which mohandas karamchand gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol 110 during the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the british the indian national congress won victories in the resulting elections 111 the next decade was beset with crises indian participation in world war ii the congresss final push for non-co-operation and an upsurge of muslim nationalism all were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of india into two states india and pakistan 112 vital to indias self-image as an independent nation was its constitution completed in 1950 which put in place a secular and democratic republic 113 it has remained a democracy with civil liberties an active supreme court and a largely independent press 114 economic liberalisation which was begun in the 1990s has created a large urban middle class transformed india into one of the worlds fastest-growing economies 115 and increased its geopolitical clout indian movies music and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture 114 yet india is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty both rural and urban 114 by religious and caste-related violence 116 by maoist-inspired naxalite insurgencies 117 and by separatism in jammu and kashmir and in northeast india 118 it has unresolved territorial disputes with china 119 and with pakistan 119 the indiapakistan nuclear rivalry came to a head in 1998 120 indias sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the worlds newer nations however in spite of its recent economic successes freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved 121 geography main article geography of india india comprises the bulk of the indian subcontinent lying atop the indian tectonic plate and part of the indo-australian plate 122 indias defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the indian plate then part of the southern supercontinent gondwana began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west and later south and south-east 122 simultaneously the vast tethyn oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the eurasian plate 122 these dual processes driven by convection in the earths mantle both created the indian ocean and caused the indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust eurasia and to uplift the himalayas 122 immediately south of the emerging himalayas plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment 123 and now constitutes the indo-gangetic plain 124 cut off from the plain by the ancient aravalli range lies the thar desert 125 the original indian plate survives as peninsular india the oldest and geologically most stable part of india it extends as far north as the satpura and vindhya ranges in central india these parallel chains run from the arabian sea coast in gujarat in the west to the coal-rich chota nagpur plateau in jharkhand in the east 126 to the south the remaining peninsular landmass the deccan plateau is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the western and eastern ghats 127 the plateau contains the countrys oldest rock formations some over one billion years old constituted in such fashion india lies to the north of the equator between 6 44 and 35 30 north latitude h and 68 7 and 97 25 east longitude 128 indias coastline measures 7517 kilometres 4700mi in length of this distance 5423 kilometres 3400mi belong to peninsular india and 2094 kilometres 1300mi to the andaman nicobar and lakshadweep island chains 129 according to the indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following 43 sandy beaches 11 rocky shores including cliffs and 46 mudflats or marshy shores 129 major himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drain into the bay of bengal 130 important tributaries of the ganges include the yamuna and the kosi the latters extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes 131 major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drain into the bay of bengal 132 and the narmada and the tapti which drain into the arabian sea 133 coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india the latter is shared with bangladesh 134 india has two archipelagos the lakshadweep coral atolls off indias south-western coast and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea 135 the indian climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons 136 the himalayas prevent cold central asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes 137 138 the thar desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that between june and october provide the majority of indias rainfall 136 four major climatic groupings predominate in india tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane 139 biodiversity main article wildlife of india india lies within the indomalaya ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots 140 one of 17 megadiverse countries it hosts 8.6 of all mammalian 13.7 of all avian 7.9 of all reptilian 6 of all amphibian 12.2 of all piscine and 6.0 of all flowering plant species 141 142 about 21.2 of the countrys landmass is covered by forests tree canopy density 10 of which 12.2 comprises moderately or very dense forests tree canopy density 40 143 endemism is high among plants 33 and among ecoregions such as the shola forests 144 habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the andaman islands western ghats and north-east india to the coniferous forest of the himalaya between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern india the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern india and the babul dominated thorn forest of the central deccan and western gangetic plain 145 the medicinal neem widely used in rural indian herbal remedies is a key indian tree the luxuriant pipal fig tree shown on the seals of mohenjo-daro shaded gautama buddha as he sought enlightenment many indian species descend from taxa originating in gondwana from which the indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present 146 peninsular india s subsequent movement towards and collision with the laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction 147 mammals then entered india from asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising himalaya 145 thus while 45.8 of reptiles and 55.8 of amphibians are endemic only 12.6 of mammals and 4.5 of birds are 142 among them are the nilgiri leaf monkey and beddomes toad of the western ghats india contains 172 iucn designated threatened animal species or 2.9 of endangered forms 148 these include the asiatic lion the bengal tiger the snow leopard and the indian white-rumped vulture which by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac laced cattle nearly became extinct the pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered indian wildlife in response the system of national parks and protected areas first established in 1935 was substantially expanded in 1972 india enacted the wildlife protection act 149 and project tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness the forest conservation act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988 150 india hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves 151 four of which are part of the world network of biosphere reserves twenty-five wetlands are registered under the ramsar convention 152 politics main article politics of india india is the worlds most populous democracy 153 a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system 154 it has seven recognised national parties including the indian national congress and the bharatiya janata party bjp and more than 40 regional parties 155 the congress is considered centre-left in indian political culture 156 and the bjp right-wing 157 158 159 for most of the period between 1950when india first became a republicand the late 1980s the congress held a majority in the parliament since then however it has increasingly shared the political stage with the bjp 160 as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre 161 in the republic of indias first three general elections in 1951 1957 and 1962 the jawaharlal nehru led congress won easy victories on nehrus death in 1964 lal bahadur shastri briefly became prime minister he was succeeded after his

saw a change in leadership in 1984 when indira gandhi was assassinated she was succeeded by her son rajiv gandhi who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year the congress was voted out again in 1989 when a national front coalition led by the newly formed janata dal in alliance with the left front won the elections that government too proved relatively short-lived lasting just under two years 162 elections were held again in 1991 no party won an absolute majority the congress as the largest single party was able to form a minority government led by p v narasimha rao 163 a two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996 several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre the bjp formed a government briefly in 1996 it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting united front coalitions which depended on external support in 1998 the bjp was able to form a successful coalition the national democratic alliance nda led by atal bihari vajpayee the nda became the first non-congress coalition government to complete a five-year term 164 in the 2004 indian general elections again no party won an absolute majority but the congress emerged as the largest single party forming another successful coalition the united progressive alliance upa it had the support of left-leaning parties and mps who opposed the bjp the upa returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers and it no longer required external support from indias communist parties 165 that year manmohan singh became the first prime minister since jawaharlal nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term 166 in the 2014 general election the bjp became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties 167 the prime minister of india is narendra modi who was formerly chief minister of gujarat on 20 july 2017 ram nath kovind was elected indias 14th president and
