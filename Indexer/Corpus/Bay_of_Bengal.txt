bay of bengal wikipedia bay of bengal the bay of bengal bengali bgopoago is the northeastern part of the indian ocean bounded on the west and north by india and bangladesh and on the east by myanmar and the andaman and nicobar islands india its southern limit is a line between sri lanka and the northwesternmost point of sumatra indonesia it is the largest water region called a bay in the world there are countries dependent on the bay of bengal in south asia and southeast asia the bay of bengal occupies an area of 2172000 square kilometres 839000sqmi a number of large rivers flow into the bay of bengal the ganges the padma the jamuna the meghna the irrawaddy the godavari the mahanadi the brahmani the baitarani the krishna and the kaveri among the important ports are chennai chittagong colombo kolkata mongla paradip port port blair tuticorin visakhapatnam and yangon among the smaller ports are dhamra kakinada and payra extent edit the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the bay of bengal as follows 3 on the east a line running from cape negrais 1603n in burma through the larger islands of the andaman group in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie eastward of the line and are excluded from the bay of bengal as far as a point in little andaman island in latitude 1048n longitude 9224e and thence along the southwest limit of the burma sea a line running from oedjong raja 532n 9512e 5533n 95200e 5.533 95.200 in sumatra to poeloe bras breuh and on through the western islands of the nicobar group to sandy point in little andaman island in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the burma sea on the south ram sethu between india and ceylon sri lanka and from the southern extreme of dondra head south point of ceylon to the north point of poeloe bras 544n 9504e 5733n 95067e 5.733 95.067 etymology edit the bay gets its name from the historical bengal region the indian state of west bengal and modern-day bangladesh in ancient scriptures this water body may have been referred to as mahodadhi sanskrit lit great water receptacle 4 5 bettersourceneeded while it appears as sinus gangeticus or gangeticus sinus meaning gulf of the ganges in ancient maps 6 the other sanskrit names for bay of bengal are vangopasagara sanskrit lit bengals bay also simply called as vangasagara sanskrit lit bengal sea and purvapayodhi sanskrit lit eastern ocean even today in bengali and odia it is known as bongoposagor rivers edit many major rivers of india flow west to east before draining into the bay of bengal the ganga is the northernmost of these its main channel enters and flows through bangladesh where it is known as the padma river before joining the meghna river however the brahmaputra river flows from east to west in assam before turning south and entering bangladesh where it is called the jamuna river this joins the padma where upon the padma joins the meghna river that finally drains into bay of bengal the sundarbans mangrove of forest of bangladesh is a forest at the delta of the padma jamuna and meghna rivers lies partly in west bengal and mostly in bangladesh the brahmaputra at 2948km 1832mi is the 28th longest river in the world it originates in tibet the hooghly river another channel of the ganga that flows through calcutta drains into bay of bengal the padmameghna-jamuna rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of sediment every year the sediment from these three rivers form the bengal delta and the submarine fan a vast structure that extends from bangladesh to south of the equator is up to 16.5 kilometres 103mi thick and contains at least 1130 trillion tonnes of sediment which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum 7 the fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion molyr 13.2 million tyr since the early miocene period the three rivers currently contribute nearly 8 of the total organic carbon toc deposited in the worlds oceans due to high toc accumulation in the deep sea bed of the bay of bengal the area is rich in oil and natural gas and gas hydrate reserves bangladesh can reclaim land substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea dikes bunds causeways and by trapping the sediment from its rivers further southwest of bangladesh the mahanadi godavari krishna and kaveri rivers also flow from west to east in south asia and drain into the bay of bengal many small rivers also drain directly into the bay of bengal the shortest of them is the cooum river at 64km 40mi the irrawaddy or ayeyarwady river in myanmar flows into the andaman sea of the bay of bengal and once had thick mangrove forests of its own seaports edit indian ports on the bay include kolkata port haldia port chennai visakhapatnam kakinada pondicherry dhamra gopalpur and bangladeshi ports on the bay are chittagong mongla payra port islands edit the islands in the bay are numerous including the andaman islands nicobar and mergui groups of india the cheduba group of islands in the north-east off the burmese coast are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes which are occasionally active great andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the andaman islands whereas ritchies archipelago consists of smaller islands only 37 or 6.5 of the 572 islands and islets of the andaman and nicobar islands are inhabited 8 beaches edit oceanography edit plate tectonics edit the lithosphere of the earth is broken up into what are called tectonic plates underneath the bay of bengal which is part of the great indo-australian plate and is slowly moving north east this plate meets the burma microplate at the sunda trench the nicobar islands and the andaman islands are part of the burma microplate the india plate subducts beneath the burma plate at the sunda trench or java trench here the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in myanmar and a volcanic arc called the sunda arc the sumatra-andaman earthquake and asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunami 11 marine geology edit a zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast to the head of the bay and thence southwards through a strip embracing the andaman and nicobar islands is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom some 50 m beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit opposite the mouth of the ganges however the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence swatch of no ground is a 14km-wide deep sea canyon of the bay of bengal the deepest recorded area of this valley is about 1340 m 12 the submarine canyon is part of the bengal fan the largest submarine fan in the world 13 14 marine biology flora and fauna edit the bay of bengal is full of biological diversity diverging amongst coral reefs estuaries fish spawning and nursery areas and mangroves the bay of bengal is one of the worlds 64 largest marine ecosystems kerilia jerdonii is a sea

to october the current is northward flowing and the clockwise circulation pattern is called the east indian current the bay of bengal monsoon moves in a northwest direction striking the nicobar islands and the andaman islands first end of may then the north eastern coast of india by end of june the remainder of the year the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing and the circulation pattern is called the east indian winter jet september and december see very active weather season varsha or monsoon in the bay of bengal producing severe cyclones which affect eastern

more commonly referred to as the british east india company gopalpur-on-sea was one of their main trading centers other trading companies along the bay of bengal shorelines were the english east india company and the french east india company 27 bimstec bay of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec supports free trade internationally around the bay of bengal between bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand the sethusamudram shipping canal project is a new venture proposed which would create a channel for a shipping route to link the gulf of mannar with the bay of bengal this would connect india from east to west without the necessity of going around sri lanka thoni and catamaran fishing boats of fishing villages thrive along the bay of bengal shorelines fishermen can catch between 26 and 44 species of marine fish 28 in one year the average catch is two million tons of fish from the bay of bengal alone 29 approximately 31 of the worlds coastal fishermen live and work on the bay 30 strategic importance edit the bay of bengal is centrally located in south and southeast asia it lies at the center of two huge economic blocks the saarc and asean it influences chinas southern landlocked region in the north and major sea ports of india and bangladesh china india and bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with malaysia thailand and indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seas 31 its outlying islands the andaman and nicobar islands and most importantly major ports such as kolkata chennai visakhapatnam tuticorin chittagong and mongla along its coast with the bay of bengal added to its importance 32 china has recently made efforts to project influence into the region through tie-ups with myanmar and bangladesh 33 the united states has held major exercises with bangladesh malaysia singapore thailand and recently india 34 35 36 37 the largest ever wargame in bay of bengal known as malabar 2007 was held in 2007 and naval warships from us bangladesh thailand singapore japan and australia took part india was a participant large deposits of natural gas in the areas within bangladeshs sea zone incited a serious urgency by india and myanmar into a territorial dispute 31 disputes over rights of some oil and gas blocks have caused brief diplomatic spats between myanmar and india with bangladesh the disputed maritime boundary between bangladesh and myanmar resulted in military tensions in 2008 and 2009 bangladesh is pursuing a settlement with myanmar and india to the boundary dispute through the international tribunal on the law of the sea 38 environmental hazards edit pollution edit the asian brown cloud a layer of air pollution that covers much of south asia and the indian ocean every year between january and march and possibly also during earlier and later months hangs over the bay of bengal it is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust smoke from cooking fires and industrial discharges 39 transboundary issues affecting the marine ecosystem edit a transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem andor its impact is separated by a national boundary or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have 2012 identified three major transboundary problems or areas of concern affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem project boblme the eight countries are now 2012 developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programme overexploitation of fisheries edit fisheries production in the bay of bengal is six million tonnes per year more than seven percent of the worlds catch the major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are a decline in the overall availability of fish resources changes in species composition of catches the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch and changes in marine biodiversity especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species the transboundary nature of these issues are that many fish stocks are shared between boblme countries through the transboundary migration of fish or larvae fishing overlaps national jurisdictions both legally and illegally overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations all countries to a greater or lesser degree are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries bay of bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered species the main causes of the issues are open access to fishing grounds government emphasis on increasing fish catches inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers increasing fishing effort especially from trawlers and purse seiners high consumer demand for fish including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture ineffective fisheries management and illegal and destructive fishing degradation of critical habitats edit the bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many endangered and vulnerable species the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats degradation of coral reefs and the loss of and damage to seagrasses the transboundary nature of these major issues are that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature climate change impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are food security needs of the coastal poor lack of coastal development plans increasing trade in products from coastal habitats coastal development and industrialization ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement upstream development that affects water-flow intensive upstream agricultural practices and increasing tourism pollution and water quality edit the major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are sewage-borne pathogens and organic load solid wastemarine litter increasing nutrient inputs oil pollution persistent organic pollutants pops and persistent toxic substances ptss sedimentation and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are discharge of untreatedpartially treated sewage being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the ganges brahmaputra meghna river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries tar balls are transported long distances popsptss and mercury including organo-mercury undergo long-range transport sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are increasing coastal population density and urbanization higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person insufficient funds allocated to waste management migration of industry into boblme countries and proliferation of small industries history edit northern circars occupied the western coast of the bay of bengal and is now considered to be indias madras state chola dynasty 9th century to 12th century when ruled by rajaraja chola i occupied the western coastline of the bay of bengal circa

material remains of ancient peoples a specialized branch archaeology of shipwrecks studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships stone anchors amphorae shards elephant tusks hippopotamus teeth ceramic pottery a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history coral reefs tsunamis cyclones mangrove swamps battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the bay of bengal 43 famous ships and
