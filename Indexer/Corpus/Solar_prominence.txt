solar prominence wikipedia solar prominence a prominence is a large bright gaseous feature extending outward from the sun s surface often in a loop shape prominences are anchored to the suns surface in the photosphere and extend outwards into the suns corona while the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases known as plasma which do not emit much visible light prominences contain much cooler plasma similar in composition to that of the chromosphere the prominence plasma is typically a hundred times more lit and denser than the coronal plasma a prominence forms over timescales of about a day and may persist in the corona for several weeks or months looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space some prominences break apart and may then give rise to coronal mass ejections scientists are currently researching how and why prominences are formed the red-glowing looped material is plasma a hot gas composed of electrically charged hydrogen and helium the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the suns internal dynamo an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward releasing the plasma a typical prominence extends over many thousands of kilometers the largest on record was estimated at over 800000 kilometres 500000mi long 1 roughly the radius of the sun historical edit the first detailed description of a solar prominence was in 14th-century laurentian codex describing the solar eclipse of 1 may 1185 they were described as flame-like tongues of live embers 2 3 prominences and filaments edit when a prominence is viewed from a different perspective so that it is against the sun instead of against space it appears darker than the surrounding background this formation is instead called a solar filament 1 it is possible for a projection to be both a filament and a prominence some prominences are so powerful that they throw out matter from the sun into space at speeds ranging from 600kms to more than 1000kms other prominences form huge loops or arching columns of glowing gases over sunspots that can reach heights of hundreds of thousands of kilometers prominences may last for a few days or even for a few months 4 videos edit play media solar prominence video clip play media an eclipse followed by an unusually large dark prominence play media on september 23 2012 the sun emitted a large blast of plasma in the form of a prominence play media on september 16 2012 the sun had a beautiful prominence that slowly twisted and dissipated over several hours play media on the final day of 2012 the sun presented a beautiful twisting prominence that rose high into the corona for about 3 hours play media on september 30 2014 multiple nasa observatories watched a filament rise but instead of erupting from the sun the filament collapsed gallery edit solar prominences detached solar prominence a limbs flare and after-flare prominence major eruptive prominence skylab 1973 solar prominence stereo behind solar prominence stereo ahead solar prominences in red visible around the edge of the sun during a solar eclipse
