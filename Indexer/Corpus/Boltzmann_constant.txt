boltzmann constant wikipedia boltzmann constant not to be confused with stefanboltzmann constant the boltzmann constant k b or k which is named after ludwig boltzmann is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas 2 it is the gas constant r divided by the avogadro constant n a the boltzmann constant has the dimension energy divided by temperature the same as entropy as of 2017 its value in si units is a measured quantity the recommended value as of 2015 with standard uncertainty in brackets is 6977138064851999999 1.380 648 52 79

adoption at the 26th general conference on weights and measures cgpm on 16 november 2018 4 the definition of the kelvin will be changed to one based on a fixed exact numerical value of the boltzmann constant similar to the way that the speed of light was given an exact numerical value at the 17th cgpm in 1983 5 the proposed final value based on the 2017 codata adjusted value of

and microscopic physics macroscopically the ideal gas law states that for an ideal gas the product of pressure p and volume v is proportional to the product of amount of substance n in moles and absolute temperature t where r is the gas constant 7000831445980000000 8.314 4598 48jk 1 mol 1 1 introducing the boltzmann constant transforms the ideal gas law into an alternative form where n is the number of molecules of gas for n 1 mol n is equal to the number of particles in one mole avogadros number role in the equipartition of energy edit main article equipartition of energy given a thermodynamic system at an absolute temperature t the average thermal energy carried by each microscopic degree of freedom in the system is on the order of magnitude of 1 2 kt ie about 6979206999999999999 2.07 10 21 j or 6979208282943310000 0.013 ev at room temperature application to simple gas thermodynamics edit in classical statistical mechanics this average is predicted to hold exactly for homogeneous ideal gases monatomic ideal gases possess three degrees of freedom per atom corresponding to the three spatial directions which means a thermal energy of 3 2 kt per atom this corresponds very well with experimental data the thermal energy can be used to calculate the root-mean-square speed of the atoms which turns out to be inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass the root mean square speeds found at room temperature accurately reflect this ranging from 7003137000000000000 1370ms for helium down to 7002240000000000000 240ms for xenon kinetic theory gives the average pressure p for an ideal gas as combination with the ideal gas law shows that the average translational kinetic energy is considering that the translational motion velocity vector v has three degrees of freedom one for each dimension gives the average energy per degree of freedom equal to one third of that ie 1 2 kt the ideal gas equation is also obeyed closely by molecular gases but the form for the heat capacity is more complicated because the molecules possess additional internal degrees of freedom as well as the three degrees of freedom for movement of the molecule as a whole diatomic gases for example possess a total of six degrees of simple freedom per molecule that are related to atomic motion three translational two rotational and one vibrational at lower temperatures not all these degrees of freedom may fully participate in the gas heat capacity due to quantum mechanical limits on the availability of excited states at the relevant thermal energy per molecule role in boltzmann factors edit more generally systems in equilibrium at temperature t have probability p i of occupying a state i with energy e weighted by the corresponding boltzmann factor where z is the partition function again it is the energy-like quantity kt that takes central importance consequences of this include in addition to the results for ideal gases above the arrhenius equation in chemical kinetics role in the statistical definition of entropy edit further information entropy statistical thermodynamics in statistical mechanics the entropy s of an isolated system at thermodynamic equilibrium is defined as the natural logarithm of w the number of distinct microscopic states available to the system given the macroscopic constraints such as a fixed total energy e this equation which relates the microscopic details or microstates of the system via w to its macroscopic state via the entropy s is the central idea of statistical mechanics such is its importance that it is inscribed on boltzmanns tombstone the constant of proportionality k serves to make the statistical mechanical entropy equal to the classical thermodynamic entropy of clausius one could choose instead a rescaled dimensionless entropy in microscopic terms such that this is a more natural form and this rescaled entropy exactly corresponds to shannons subsequent information entropy the characteristic energy kt is thus the energy required to increase the rescaled entropy by one nat role in semiconductor physics the thermal voltage edit in semiconductors the shockley diode equation the relationship between the flow of electric current and the electrostatic potential across a pn junction depends on a characteristic voltage called the thermal voltage denoted v t the thermal voltage depends on absolute temperature t as where q is the magnitude of the electrical charge on the electron with a value 6981160217662079999 1.602 176 6208 98 10 19 c 1 and k is the boltzmann constant 6977138064852099999 1.380 648 521 79 10 23 jk in electronvolts the boltzmann constant is 6977138064839873726 8.617 3303 50 10 5 evk 1 making it easy to calculate that at room temperature 7002300000000000000 300k the value of the thermal voltage is approximately 2585millivolts 6998260000000000000 26mv 8 the thermal voltage is also important in plasmas and electrolyte solutions in both cases it provides a measure of how much the spatial distribution of electrons or ions is affected by a boundary held at a fixed voltage 9 10 history edit although boltzmann first linked entropy and probability in 1877 it seems the relation was never expressed with a specific constant until max planck first introduced k and gave a precise value for it 6977134600000000000 1.346 10 23 jk about 2.5 lower than todays figure in his derivation of the law of black body radiation in 19001901 11 before 1900 equations involving boltzmann factors were not written using the energies per molecule and the boltzmann constant but rather using a form of the gas constant r and macroscopic energies for macroscopic quantities of the substance the iconic terse form of the equation s k ln w on boltzmanns tombstone is in fact due to planck not boltzmann planck actually introduced it in the same work as his eponymous h 12 in 1920 planck wrote in his nobel prize lecture 13 this constant is often referred to as boltzmanns constant although to my knowledge boltzmann himself never introduced it a peculiar state of affairs which can be explained by the fact that boltzmann as appears from his occasional utterances never gave thought to the possibility of carrying out an exact measurement of the constant this peculiar state of affairs is illustrated by reference to one of the great scientific debates of the time there was considerable disagreement in the second half of the nineteenth century as to whether atoms and molecules were real or whether they were simply a heuristic tool for solving problems there was no agreement whether chemical molecules as measured by atomic weights were the same as physical molecules as measured by kinetic theory plancks 1920 lecture continued 13 nothing can better illustrate the positive and hectic pace of progress which the art of experimenters has made over the past twenty years than the fact that since that time not only one but a great number of methods have been discovered for measuring the mass of a molecule with practically the same accuracy as that attained for a planet in 2017 the most accurate measures of the boltzmann constant were obtained by acoustic gaz thermometry which consists on determining the speed of sound of a monatomic gas in a triaxial ellipsoid chamber using microwave and acoustic resonances 14 15 this decade-long effort was undertaken with different techniques by several laboratories a it is one of the founding stones of the 2018 redefinition of the international system of units based on these measurements 16 the codata recommended 1.380 649 10 23 jk 1 to be the final fixed value of the boltzmann constant to be used for the international system of units value in different units edit see also new si definitions since k is a physical constant of proportionality between temperature and energy its numerical value depends on the choice of units for energy and temperature the small numerical value of the boltzmann constant in si units means a change in temperature by 1k only changes a particles energy by a small amount a change of 7002274149999999999 1 c is defined to be the same as a change of 7000100000000000000 1k the characteristic energy kt is a term encountered in many physical relationships the boltzmann constant sets up a relationship between wavelength and temperature dividing hc k by a wavelength gives a temperature with one micrometer being related to 14387770k and also a relationship between voltage and temperature multiplying the voltage by k in units of evk with one volt being related to 11604519k the ratio of these two temperatures 14387770k11604519k1239842 is the numerical value of hc in units of evm planck units edit the boltzmann constant provides a mapping from this characteristic microscopic energy e to the macroscopic temperature scale t e k in physics research another definition is often encountered in setting k to unity resulting in the planck units or natural units for temperature and energy in this context temperature is measured effectively in units of energy and the boltzmann constant is not explicitly needed 17 the equipartition formula for the energy associated with each classical degree of freedom then becomes the use of natural units simplifies many physical relationships in this form the definition of thermodynamic entropy coincides with the form of information entropy where p i is the probability of each microstate the value chosen for a unit of the planck temperature is that corresponding to the energy of the planck mass or
