high resolution coronal imager wikipedia high resolution coronal imager the high resolution coronal imager hi-c is a sub-orbital telescope designed to take high-resolution images of the suns corona it was launched on july 11 2012 aboard a black brant sounding rocket from white sands missile range new mexico 1 the images taken were the highest resolution photos ever of the suns corona 2 telescope description edit the telescope weighs 464 pounds 210kg and is 10 feet 30m long 2 the mirrors are approximately 9.5 inches 24cm across its optics were designed at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama with assistance from the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and l-3comtinsley laboratories of richmond california dr jonathan cirtain from msfl said these mirrors were to be the finest pieces of glass ever fabricated for solar astrophysics 3 imaging system edit the imaging system was designed by apogee imaging systems with a resolution of 0.1 arcsecpixel 14 times higher resolution than the solar dynamics observatory it was based on a customized version of the e2v ccd203 from lockheed martin which is a very large 4 channel back illuminated 4000 4000 pixel charge-coupled device ccd 1 mission edit the flight lasted for 10 minutes reached an altitude of 283 kilometres 176mi and the telescope captured 165 images of a large active region it imaged the sun in ultraviolet light at 193nm wavelength 4 the total cost of the mission was 5 million 5 findings edit the experiment revealed never-before-seen magnetic braids of plasma roiling in the suns outer layers 2 it was the first time scientists were able to directly observe magnetic reconnection in braids which may be the primary sources of heating in the active solar corona 4 6
