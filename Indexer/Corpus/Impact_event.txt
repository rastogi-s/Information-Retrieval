impact event wikipedia impact event an impact event is a collision between astronomical objects causing measurable effects impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems though the most frequent involve asteroids comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact when large objects impact terrestrial planets like the earth there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry impact craters and structures are dominant landforms on many of the solar system s solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale impact events appear to have played a significant role in the evolution of the solar system since its formation major impact events have significantly shaped earths history have been implicated in the formation of the earthmoon system the evolutionary history of life the origin of water on earth and several mass extinctions notable impact events include the chicxulub impact 66 million years ago believed to be the cause of the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 1 throughout recorded history hundreds of earth impacts and exploding bolides have been reported with some occurrences causing deaths injuries property damage or other significant localised consequences 2 one of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times was the tunguska event which occurred in siberia russia in 1908 the 2013 chelyabinsk meteor event is the only known such incident in modern times to result in a large number of injuries excluding the 1490 ching-yang event in china the chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have encountered the earth since the tunguska event the asteroid impact that caused mistastin crater generated temperatures exceeding 2370c the highest temperatures known to have occurred on earth 3 the comet shoemakerlevy 9 impact provided the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects when the comet broke apart and collided with jupiter in july 1994 an extrasolar impact was observed in 2013 when a massive terrestrial planet impact was detected around the star id8 in the star cluster ngc 2547 by nasas spitzer space telescope and confirmed by ground observations 4 impact events have been a plot and background element in science fiction impacts and the earth edit major impact events have significantly shaped earths history having been implicated in the formation of the earthmoon system the evolutionary history of life the origin of water on earth and several mass extinctions impact structures are the result of impact events on solid objects and as the dominant landforms on many of the systems solid objects present the most solid evidence of prehistoric events notable impact events include the late heavy bombardment which occurred early in history of the earthmoon system and the chicxulub impact 66 million years ago believed to be the cause of the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event frequency and risk edit main article asteroid-impact avoidance frequency of small asteroids roughly 1 to 20 meters in diameter impacting earths atmosphere small objects frequently collide with earth there is an inverse relationship between the size of the object and the frequency of such events the lunar cratering record shows that the frequency of impacts decreases as approximately the cube of the resulting craters diameter which is on average proportional to the diameter of the impactor 6 asteroids with a 1km 062mi diameter strike earth every 500000 years on average 7 large collisions with 5km 3mi objects happen approximately once every twenty million years 8 the last known impact of an object of 10km 6mi or more in diameter was at the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago 9 the energy released by an impactor depends on diameter density velocity and angle 8 the diameter of most near-earth asteroids that have not been studied by radar or infrared can generally only be estimated within about a factor of 2 based on the asteroid brightness the density is generally assumed because the diameter and mass are also generally estimates the minimum impact velocity on earth is 11 kms clarification needed with asteroid impacts averaging around 17kms 8 the most probable impact angle is 45 degrees 8 airbursts edit stony asteroids with a diameter of 4 meters 13ft enter earths atmosphere approximately once per year 8 asteroids with a diameter of 7 meters enter the atmosphere about every 5 years with as much kinetic energy as the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima approximately 16 kilotons of tnt but the air burst is reduced to just 5 kilotons 8 these ordinarily explode in the upper atmosphere and most or all of the solids are vaporized 10 however asteroids with a diameter of 20m 66ft and which strike earth approximately twice every century produce more powerful airbursts the 2013 chelyabinsk meteor was estimated to be about 20 m in diameter with an airburst of around 500 kilotons an explosion 30 times the one over hiroshima much larger objects may impact the solid earth and create a crater objects with a diameter less than 1m 33ft are called meteoroids and seldom make it to the ground to become meteorites an estimated 500 meteorites reach the surface each year but only 5 or 6 of these typically create a weather radar signature with a strewn field large enough to be recovered and be made known to scientists the late eugene shoemaker of the us geological survey estimated the rate of earth impacts concluding that an event about the size of the nuclear weapon that destroyed hiroshima occurs about once a year citation needed such events would seem to be spectacularly obvious but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons the majority of the earths surface is covered by water a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage citation needed although no human is known to have been killed directly by an impact disputed discuss over 1000 people were injured by the chelyabinsk meteor airburst event over russia in 2013 11 in 2005 it was estimated that the chance of a single person born today dying due to an impact is around 1 in 200000 12 the four-meter-sized asteroids 2008 tc 3 and 2014 aa and suspected artificial satellite wt1190f are the only known objects to be detected before impacting the earth 13 14 geological significance edit impacts have had during the history of the earth a significant geological 15 and climatic 16 influence the moon s existence is widely attributed to a huge impact early in earths history 17 impact events earlier in the history of earth have been credited with creative as well as destructive events it has been proposed that impacting comets delivered the earths water and some have suggested that the origins of life may have been influenced by impacting objects by bringing organic chemicals or lifeforms to the earths surface a theory known as exogenesis these modified views of earths history did not emerge until relatively recently chiefly due to a lack of direct observations and the difficulty in recognizing the signs of an earth impact because of erosion and weathering large-scale terrestrial impacts of the sort that produced the barringer crater locally known as meteor crater northeast of flagstaff arizona are rare instead it was widely thought that cratering was the result of volcanism the barringer crater for example was ascribed to a prehistoric volcanic explosion not an unreasonable hypothesis given that the volcanic san francisco peaks stand only 30 miles 48km to the west similarly the craters on the surface of the moon were ascribed to volcanism it was not until 19031905 that the barringer crater was correctly identified as an impact crater and it was not until as recently as 1963 that research by eugene merle shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis the findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the solar systems solid bodies every surveyed solid body in the solar system was found to be cratered and there was no reason to believe that the earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space in the last few decades of the 20th century a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified the first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994 the collision of the comet shoemaker-levy 9 with jupiter based on crater formation rates determined from the earths closest celestial partner the moon astrogeologists have determined that during the last 600 million years the earth has been struck by 60 objects of a diameter of 5km 3mi or more citation needed the smallest of these impactors would leave a crater almost 100km 60mi across only three confirmed craters from that time period with that size or greater have been found chicxulub popigai and manicouagan and all three have been suspected of being linked to extinction events 18 19 though only chicxulub the largest of the three has been consistently considered besides direct effect of asteroid impacts on a planets surface topography global climate and life recent studies have shown that several consecutive impacts might have an effect on the dynamo mechanism at a planets core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet and might eventually shut down the planets magnetic field 20 while numerous impact craters have been confirmed on land or in the shallow seas over continental shelves no impact craters in the deep ocean have been widely accepted by the scientific community 21 impacts of projectiles as large as onekm in diameter are generally thought to explode before reaching the sea floor but it is unknown what would happen if a much larger impactor struck the deep ocean the lack of a crater however does not mean that an ocean impact would not have dangerous implications for humanity some scholars have argued that an impact event in an ocean or sea may create a megatsunami a giant wave which can cause destruction both at sea and on land along the coast 22 but this is disputed 23 an example of an ocean impact is the large but apparently craterless eltanin impact into the pacific ocean in 2.5 ma and is thought to involve an object about 1 to 4 kilometres 0.62 to 249mi across an impact event may cause a mantle plume volcanism at the antipodal point of the impact 24 biospheric effects edit the effect of impact events on the biosphere has been the subject of scientific debate several theories of impact-related mass extinction have been developed in the past 500 million years there have been five generally accepted major mass extinctions that on average extinguished half of all species 25 one of the largest mass extinctions to have affected life on earth was the permian-triassic which ended the permian period 250 million years ago and killed off 90 percent of all species 26 life on earth took 30 million years to recover 27 the cause of the permian-triassic extinction is still a matter of debate the age and origin of proposed impact craters ie the bedout high structure hypothesized to be associated with it are still controversial 28 the last such mass extinction led to the demise of the dinosaurs and coincided with a large meteorite impact this is the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event also known as the kt or kpg extinction event which occurred 66 million years ago there is no definitive evidence of impacts leading to the three other major mass extinctions in 1980 physicist luis alvarez his son geologist walter alvarez and nuclear chemists frank asaro and helen v michael from the university of california berkeley discovered unusually high concentrations of iridium in a specific layer of rock strata in the earths crust iridium is an element that is rare on earth but relatively abundant in many meteorites from the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65-million-year-old iridium layer the alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of 10 to 14km 6 to 9mi must have collided with the earth this iridium layer at the cretaceouspaleogene boundary has been found worldwide at 100 different sites multidirectionally shocked quartz coesite which is normally associated with large impact events 29 or atomic bomb explosions has also been found in the same layer at more than 30 sites soot and ash at levels tens of thousands times normal levels were found with the above anomalies in chromium isotopic ratios found within the k-t boundary layer strongly support the impact theory 30 chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth and therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin which has also been proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment further the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the k-t boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in carbonaceous chondrites thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites probably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named chicxulub crater this crater is centered on the yucatn peninsula of mexico and was discovered by tony camargo and glen pentfield while working as geophysicists for the mexican oil company pemex what they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180km 110mi in diameter this convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period although there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the k-t boundary layer remnants have been found of other smaller impacts some nearing half the size of the chicxulub crater which did not result in any mass extinctions and there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction 25 paleontologists david m raup and jack sepkoski have proposed that an excess of extinction events occurs roughly every 26 million years though many are relatively minor this led physicist richard a muller to suggest that these extinctions could be due to a hypothetical companion star to the sun called nemesis periodically disrupting the orbits of comets in the oort cloud leading to a large increase in the number of comets reaching the inner solar system where they might hit earth physicist adrian melott and paleontologist richard bambach have more recently verified the raup and sepkoski finding but argue that it is not consistent with the characteristics expected of a nemesis-style periodicity 31 sociological and cultural effects edit main article end of civilization an impact event is commonly seen as a scenario that would bring about the end of civilization in 2000 discover magazine published a list of 20 possible sudden doomsday scenarios with an impact event listed as the most likely to occur 32 a joint pew research center smithsonian survey from april 2126 2010 found that 31 percent of americans believed that an asteroid will collide with earth by 2050 a majority 61 percent disagreed 33 earth impacts edit in the early history of the earth about four billion years ago bolide impacts were almost certainly common since the solar system contained far more discrete bodies than at present such impacts could have included strikes by asteroids hundreds of kilometers in diameter with explosions so powerful that they vaporized all the earths oceans it was not until this heavy bombardment slackened that life appears to have begun to evolve on earth the leading theory of the moons origin is the giant impact theory which postulates that earth was once hit by a planetoid the size of mars such a theory is able to explain the size and composition of the moon something not done by other theories of lunar formation 34 evidence of a massive impact in south africa near a geological formation known as the barberton greenstone belt was uncovered by scientists in april 2014 they estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago and that the impactor was approximately 3758 kilometers 2336 miles wide the crater from this event if it still exists has not yet been found 35 two 10-kilometre sized asteroids are now believed to have struck australia between 360 and 300 million years ago at the western warburton and east warburton basins creating a 400-kilometre impact zone according to evidence found in 2015 it is the largest ever recorded 36 a third possible impact was also identified in 2015 to the north on the upper diamantina river also believed to have been caused by an asteroid 10km across about 300 million years ago but further studies are needed to establish that this crustal anomaly was indeed the result of an impact event 37 pleistocene edit further information pleistocene artifacts recovered with tektites from the 803000-year-old australasian strewnfield event in asia link a homo erectus population to a significant meteorite impact and its aftermath 38 39 40 significant examples of pleistocene impacts include the lonar crater lake in india approximately 52000 years old though a study published in 2010 gives a much greater age which now has a flourishing semi-tropical jungle around it citation needed holocene edit further information holocene the rio cuarto craters in argentina were produced approximately 10000 years ago at the beginning of the holocene if proved to be impact craters they would be the first impact of the holocene the campo del cielo field of heaven refers to an area bordering argentinas chaco province where a group of iron meteorites were found estimated as dating to 40005000 years ago it first came to attention of spanish authorities in 1576 in 2015 police arrested four alleged smugglers trying to steal more than a ton of protected meteorites 41 the henbury craters in australia 5000 years old and kaali craters in estonia 2700 years old were apparently produced by objects that broke up before impact citation needed whitecourt crater in alberta canada is estimated to be between 1080 and 1130 years old the crater is approximately 36m 118ft in diameter and 9m 30ft deep is heavily forested and was discovered in 2007 when a metal detector revealed fragments of meteoric iron scattered around the area 42 43 a chinese record states that 10000 people were killed in the 1490 ching-yang event with the deaths caused by a hail of falling stones some astronomers hypothesize that this may describe an actual meteorite fall although they find the number of deaths implausible 44 kamil crater discovered from google earth image review in egypt 45m 148ft in diameter and 10m 33ft deep is thought to have been formed less than 3500 years ago in a then-unpopulated region of western egypt it was found february 19 2009 by v de michelle on a google earth image of the east uweinat desert egypt 45 20th-century impacts edit one of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times was the tunguska event which occurred in siberia russia in 1908 this incident involved an explosion that was probably caused by the airburst of an asteroid or comet 5 to 10km 3.1 to 62mi above the earths surface felling an estimated 80 million trees over 2150km 2 830sqmi 46 in february 1947 another large bolide impacted the earth in the sikhote-alin mountains primorye soviet union it was during daytime so was witnessed by many people which allowed v g fesenkov then chairman of the meteorite committee of the ussr academy of science to estimate the meteoroids orbit before it encountered the earth sikhote-alin is a massive fall with the overall size of the meteoroid estimated at approximately 90000kg 200000lb a more recent estimate by tsvetkov and others puts the mass at around 100000kg 220000lb 47 it was an iron meteorite belonging to the chemical group iiab and with a coarse octahedrite structure more than 70 tonnes metric tons of material survived the collision a case of a human injured by a space rock occurred on november 30 1954 in sylacauga alabama 48 there a 4kg 88lb stone chondrite crashed through a roof and hit ann hodges in her living room after it bounced off her radio she was badly bruised by the fragments several persons have since claimed to have been struck by meteorites but no verifiable meteorites have resulted a small number of meteor falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point the first of these was the pribram meteorite which fell in czechoslovakia now the czech republic in 1959 49 in this case two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball the images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and more significantly to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite following the pribram fall other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites one of these was the prairie network operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern us this program also observed a meteorite fall the lost city chondrite allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit 50 another program in canada the meteorite observation and recovery project ran from 1971 to 1985 it too recovered a single meteorite innisfree in 1977 51 finally observations by the european fireball network a descendant of the original czech program that recovered pribram led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the neuschwanstein meteorite in 2002 52 on august 10 1972 a meteor which became known as the 1972 great daylight fireball was witnessed by many people as it moved north over the rocky mountains from the us southwest to canada it was filmed by a tourist at the grand teton national park in wyoming with an 8-millimeter color movie camera 53 the object was in the range of size from a car to a house and could have ended its life in a hiroshima-sized blast but there was never any explosion analysis of the trajectory indicated that it never came much lower than 58km 36mi off the ground and the conclusion was that it had grazed earths atmosphere for about 100 seconds then skipped back out of the atmosphere to return to its orbit around the sun many impact events occur without being observed by anyone on the ground between 1975 and 1992 american missile early warning satellites picked up 136 major explosions in the upper atmosphere 54 in the november 21 2002 edition of the journal nature peter brown of the university of western ontario reported on his study of us early warning satellite records for the preceding eight years he identified 300 flashes caused by 1 to 10m 3 to 33ft meteors in that time period and estimated the rate of tunguska-sized events as once in 400 years 55 eugene shoemaker estimated that an event of such magnitude occurs about once every 300 years though more recent analyses have suggested he exaggerated by an order of magnitude in the dark morning hours of january 18 2000 a fireball exploded over the city of whitehorse yukon territory at an altitude of about 26km 16mi lighting up the night like day the meteor that produced the fireball was estimated to be about 46m 15ft in diameter with a weight of 180 tonnes this blast was also featured on the science channel series killer asteroids with several witness reports from residents in atlin british columbia 21st-century impacts edit on 7 june 2006 a meteor was observed striking reisadalen in nordreisa municipality in troms county norway although initial witness reports stated that the resultant fireball was equivalent to the hiroshima nuclear explosion scientific analysis places the force of the blast at anywhere from 100500 tonnes tnt equivalent around three percent of hiroshimas yield 56 on 15 september 2007 a chondritic meteor crashed near the village of carancas in southeastern peru near lake titicaca leaving a water-filled hole and spewing gases across the surrounding area many residents became ill apparently from the noxious gases shortly after the impact on 7 october 2008 a meteoroid labeled 2008 tc 3 was tracked for 20 hours as it approached earth and as it fell through the atmosphere and impacted in sudan this was the first time an object was detected before it reached the atmosphere and hundreds of pieces of the meteorite were recovered from the nubian desert 57 on 15 february 2013 an asteroid entered earths atmosphere over russia as a fireball and exploded above the city of chelyabinsk during its passage through the ural mountains region at 0913 yekt 0313 utc 58 59 the objects air burst occurred at an altitude between 30 and 50km 19 and 31mi above the ground 60 and about 1500 people were injured mainly by broken window glass shattered by the shock wave two were reported in serious condition however there were no fatalities 61 initially some 3000 buildings in six cities across the region were reported damaged due to the explosions shock wave a figure which rose to over 7200 in the following weeks 62 63 the chelyabinsk meteor was estimated to have caused over 30 million in damage 64 65 it is the largest recorded object to have encountered the earth since the 1908 tunguska event by far the best documented and the only such event known to have resulted in a large number of casualties 66 67 the meteor is estimated to have an initial diameter of 1720 metres and a mass of roughly 10000 tonnes on 16 october 2013 a team from ural federal university led by victor grokhovsky recovered a large fragment of the meteor from the bottom of russias lake chebarkul about 80km west of the city 68 on 1 january 2014 a 3 meter 10 foot asteroid 2014 aa was discovered by the mount lemmon survey and observed over the next hour and was soon found to be on a collision course with earth the exact location was uncertain constrained to a line between panama the central atlantic ocean the gambia and ethiopia around roughly the time expected 2 january 306 utc an infrasound burst was detected near the center of the impact range in the middle of the atlantic ocean this marks the second time a natural object was identified prior to impacting earth after 2008 tc3 nearly two years later on october 3 wt1190f was detected orbiting earth on a highly eccentric orbit taking it from well within the geocentric satellite ring to nearly twice the orbit of the moon it was estimated to be perturbed by the moon onto a collision course with earth on november 13 with over a month of observations as well as precovery observations found dating back to 2009 it was found to be far less dense than a natural asteroid should be suggesting that it was most likely an unidentified artificial satellite as predicted it fell over sri lanka at 618 utc 1148 local time the sky in the region was very overcast so only an airborne observation team was able to successfully observe it falling above the clouds it is now thought to be a remnant of the lunar prospector mission in 1998 and is the third time any previously unknown object natural or artificial was identified prior to impact on 22 january 2018 an object a106fgf was discovered by the asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system and identified as possibly impacting earth later that day while a very close approach to earth was not ruled out entirely the odds of impact were fairly likely as it was very dim and only identified hours before its approach no more than the initial 4 observations covering a 39-minute period were made of the object it is unknown if it impacted earth or not but no fireball was detected in either infrared or infrasound so if it did it would have been very small and likely near the eastern end of its potential impact area in the western pacific ocean elsewhere in the solar system edit evidence of massive past impact events edit main article list of largest craters in the solar system impact craters provide evidence of past impacts on other planets in the solar system including possible interplanetary terrestrial impacts without carbon dating other points of reference are used to estimate the timing of these impact events mars provides some significant evidence of possible interplanetary collisions the north polar basin on mars is speculated by some to be evidence for a planet-sized impact on the surface of mars between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago while utopia planitia is the largest confirmed impact and hellas planitia is the largest visible crater in the solar system the moon provides similar evidence of massive impacts with the south poleaitken basin being the biggest mercury s caloris basin is another example of a crater formed by a massive impact event rheasilvia on vesta is an example of a crater formed by an impact capable of based on ratio of impact to size severely deforming a planetary-mass object impact craters on the moons of saturn such as engelier and gerin on iapetus mamaldi on rhea and odysseus on tethys and herschel on mimas form significant surface features observed events edit jupiter edit on july 1994 comet shoemakerlevy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided with jupiter providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects 70 the event served as a wake-up call and astronomers responded by starting programs such as lincoln near-earth asteroid research linear near-earth asteroid tracking neat lowell observatory near-earth object search loneos and several others which have drastically increased the rate of asteroid discovery the 2009 jupiter impact event happened on july 19 when a new black spot about the size of earth was discovered in jupiters southern hemisphere by amateur astronomer anthony wesley thermal infrared analysis showed it was warm and spectroscopic methods detected ammonia jpl scientists confirmed that there was another impact event on jupiter probably involving a small undiscovered comet or other icy body 71 72 73 the impactor is estimated to have been about 200500 meters in diameter a 2010 jupiter impact event occurred on june 3 involving an object estimated at 813 meters was recorded and first reported by anthony wesley 74 75 76 on sept 10 2012 amateur astronomer dan petersen visually detected a fireball on jupiter that lasted 1 or 2 seconds using a 12 lx200 it was estimated that the fireball was created by a meteoroid less than 10 meters in diameter 77 on march 17 2016 a jupiter impact event occurred involving an unknown object possibly a small comet or asteroid estimated at 3090 meters or a few hundred feet across footage of the event was recorded from the telescope of amateur astronomer john mckeon 78 other impacts edit in 1998 two comets were observed plunging toward the sun in close succession the first of these was on june 1 and the second the next day a video of this followed by a dramatic ejection of solar gas unrelated to the impacts can be found at the nasa 79 website both of these comets evaporated before coming into contact with the surface of the sun according to a theory by nasa jet propulsion laboratory scientist zdenk sekanina the latest impactor to actually make contact with the sun was the supercomet howard-koomen-michels on august 30 1979 80 self-published source see also sungrazer in 2010 between january and may hubble s wide field camera 3 81 took images of an unusual x shape originated in the aftermath of the collision between asteroid p2010 a2 with a smaller asteroid around march 27 2012 based on evidence there were signs of an impact on mars images from the mars reconnaissance orbiter provide compelling evidence of the largest impact observed to date on mars in the form of fresh craters the largest measuring 48.5 by 43.5 meters it is estimated to be caused by an impactor 3 to 5 meters long 82 on march 19 2013 an impact occurred on the moon that was visible from earth when a boulder-sized 30cm meteoroid slammed into the lunar surface at 90000kmh 56000mph creating a 20-meter crater 83 84 nasa has actively monitored lunar impacts since 2005 85 tracking hundreds of candidate events 86 extrasolar impacts edit collisions between galaxies or galaxy mergers have been observed directly by space telescopes such as hubble and spitzer however collisions in planetary systems including stellar collisions while long speculated have only recently begun to be observed directly in 2013 an impact between minor planets was detected around the star ngc 2547 by spitzer and confirmed by ground observations computer modelling suggests that the impact involved large asteroids or protoplanets similar to the events believed to have led to the formation of terrestrial planets like the earth 4 popular culture edit science fiction novels edit main article asteroids in fiction collisions with planets numerous science fiction stories and novels center around an impact event one of the first and more popular is off on a comet french hector servadac by jules verne published in 1877 and h g wells wrote about such an event in his 1897 short story the star in more modern times possibly the best-selling was the novel lucifers hammer by larry niven and jerry pournelle arthur c clarke s novel rendezvous with rama opens with a significant asteroid impact in northern italy in the year 2077 which gives rise to the spaceguard project which later discovers the rama spacecraft in 1992 a congressional study in the us led to nasa being directed to undertake the spaceguard survey with the novel being named as the inspiration for the name to search for earth-impacting asteroids 87 this in turn inspired clarkes 1993 novel the hammer of god a variation on the traditional impact story was provided by jack mcdevitt s 1999 novel moonfall in which a very large comet traveling at interstellar velocities collides with and partially destroys the moon fragments of which then collide with the earth the 1985 niven and pournelle novel footfall features the examination of the effects
