equation of state wikipedia equation of state for the use of this in cosmology see equation of state cosmology for the use of this concept in optimal control theory see optimal control general method in physics and thermodynamics an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions such as pressure volume temperature pvt or internal energy 1 equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids mixtures of fluids solids and the interior of stars overview edit the most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures one of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures however this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid therefore a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids at present there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions measurements of equation-of-state parameters especially at high pressures can be made using lasers 2 3 4 in addition there are also equations of state describing solids including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another there are equations that model the interior of stars including neutron stars dense matter quarkgluon plasmas and radiation fields a related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology in practical context the equations of state are instrumental for pvt calculation in process engineering problems and especially in petroleum gasliquid equilibrium calculations a successful pvt model based on a fitting equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids piping and sizing historical edit boyles law 1662 edit boyles law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state citation needed in 1662 the irish physicist and chemist robert boyle performed a series of experiments employing a j-shaped glass tube which was sealed on one end mercury was added to the tube trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short sealed end of the tube then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube the pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long open end through these experiments boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure in mathematical form this can be stated as the above relationship has also been attributed to edme mariotte and is sometimes referred to as mariottes law however mariottes work was not published until 1676 charless law or law of charles and gay-lussac 1787 edit in 1787 the french physicist jacques charles found that oxygen nitrogen hydrogen carbon dioxide and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval later in 1802 joseph louis gay-lussac published results of similar experiments indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature daltons law of partial pressures 1801 edit daltons law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone mathematically this can be represented for n species as the ideal gas law 1834 edit in 1834 mile clapeyron combined boyles law and charles law into the first statement of the ideal gas law initially the law was formulated as pv m r t c 267 with temperature expressed in degrees celsius where r is the gas constant however later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2 and then the celsius scale was defined with 0c 273.15 k giving van der waals equation of state 1873 edit in 1873 j d van der waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules 5 his new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state and was most famously continued via the redlichkwong equation of state and the soave modification of redlich-kwong major equations of state edit for a given amount of substance contained in a system the temperature volume and pressure are not independent quantities they are connected by a relationship of the general form in the following equations the variables are defined as follows any consistent set of units may be used although si units are preferred absolute temperature refers to use of the kelvin k or rankine r temperature scales with zero being absolute zero pressure absolute volume number of moles of a substance molar volume the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid absolute temperature ideal gas constant 8.3144621 jmolk pressure at the critical point molar volume at the critical point absolute temperature at the critical point classical ideal gas law edit the classical ideal gas law may be written in the form shown above the equation of state is thus if the calorically perfect gas approximation is used then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows where is the density is the adiabatic index ratio of specific heats is the internal energy per unit mass the specific internal energy is the specific heat at constant volume and is the specific heat at constant pressure cubic equations of state edit cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of v m van der waals equation of state edit the van der waals equation of state may be written where is molar volume the substance-specific constants and can be calculated from the critical properties and noting that is the molar volume at the critical point as also written as proposed in 1873 the van der waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law in this landmark equation is called the attraction parameter and the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume while the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms while the van der waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons it is now obsolete other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate the van der waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law improved due to two independent reasons molecules are thought as particles with volume not material points thus cannot be too little less than some constant so we get instead of while ideal gas molecules do not interact we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules radii it makes no effect inside the material but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface we see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell which is used in the ideal gas law so we write something instead of to evaluate this something lets examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface while the force acting on each surface molecule is the force acting on the whole element is with the reduced state variables ie v r v m v c p r pp c and t r tt c the reduced form of the van der waals equation can be formulated the benefit of this form is that for given t r and p r the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using cardanos method for the reduced cubic form for p r 1 and t r 1 the system is in a state of vaporliquid equilibrium the reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions the largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume redlich-kwong equation of state edit introduced in 1949 the redlich-kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time it is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form while superior to the van der waals equation of state it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vaporliquid equilibria however it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose the redlich-kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure reduced pressure is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature reduced temperature soave modification of redlich-kwong edit where is the acentric factor for the species this formulation for is due to graboski and daubert the original formulation from soave is for hydrogen we can also write it in the polynomial form with then we have where is the universal gas constant and zpvrt is the compressibility factor in 1972 g soave 6 replaced the 1 t term of the redlich-kwong equation with a function t involving the temperature and the acentric factor the resulting equation is also known as the soave-redlich-kwong equation of state srk eos the function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials note especially that this replacement changes the definition of a slightly as the is now to the second power volume translation of peneloux et alios edit the srk eos may be written as where where and other parts of the srk eos is defined in the srk eos section a downside of the srk eos and other cubic eos is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume peneloux et alios 1982 7 proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation where is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly on the liquid branch of the eos a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure on the gas branch of the eos a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch thus the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small unfortunately there are two versions that occur in science and industry in the first version only is translated 8 9 and the eos becomes in the second version both and are translated or the translation of is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter b-c 10 this gives the c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by the c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation where the rackett compressibility factor can be estimated by a nice feature with the volume translation method of peneloux et alios 1982 is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations 11 it should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic eoss if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected eos pengrobinson equation of state edit in polynomial form where is the acentric factor of the species is the universal gas constant and zpvnrt is compressibility factor the pengrobinson equation of state pr eos was developed in 1976 at the university of alberta by ding-yu peng and donald robinson in order to satisfy the following goals 12 the parameters should be expressible in terms of the critical properties and the acentric factor the model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point particularly for calculations of the compressibility factor and liquid density the mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter which should be independent of temperature pressure and composition the equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes for the most part the pengrobinson equation exhibits performance similar to the soave equation although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials especially nonpolar ones 13 the departure functions of the pengrobinson equation are given on a separate article pengrobinson-stryjek-vera equations of state edit prsv1 edit a modification to the attraction term in the pengrobinson equation of state published by stryjek and vera in 1986 prsv significantly improved the models accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor 14 the modification is where is an adjustable pure component parameter stryjek and vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article at reduced temperatures above 0.7 they recommend to set and simply use for alcohols and water the value of may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures 14 prsv2 edit a subsequent modification published in 1986 prsv2 further improved the models accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification 15 the modification is where and are adjustable pure component parameters prsv2 is particularly advantageous for vle calculations while prsv1 does offer an advantage over the pengrobinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior it is still not accurate enough in general for phase equilibrium calculations 14 the highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors it is therefore recommended that prsv2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design however once the equilibrium state has been determined the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy 15 one thing to note is that in the prsv equation the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature above the critical temperature the prsv alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0 because of this alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point this is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point several alternate formulations have been proposed some well known ones are by twu et all or by mathias and copeman elliott suresh donohue equation of state edit the elliott suresh and donohue esd equation of state was proposed in 1990 16 the equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the pengrobinson eos in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der waals repulsive term the eos accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term not shown the eos itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size shape and hydrogen bonding where and is a shape factor with for spherical molecules for non-spherical molecules the following relation is suggested where is the acentric factor the reduced number density is defined as where is the characteristic size parameter is the number of molecules is the volume of the container the characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter through where and is boltzmanns constant noting the relationships between boltzmanns constant and the universal gas constant and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of avogadros number and the molar mass the reduced number density can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as the shape parameter appearing in the attraction term and the term are given by and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules where is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by and are constants in the equation of state for spherical molecules c1 for spherical molecules c1 for spherical molecules c1 the model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components details are in the paper by jr elliott jr et al 1990 16 non-cubic equations of state edit dieterici equation of state edit where a is associated with the interaction between molecules and b takes into account the finite size of the molecules similar to the van der waals equation the reduced coordinates are virial equations of state edit virial equation of state edit main article virial expansion although usually not the most convenient equation of state the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from statistical mechanics this equation is also called the kamerlingh onnes equation if appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients a is the first virial coefficient which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large all fluids behave like ideal gases the second virial coefficient b corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules c to triplets and so on accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms the coefficients b c d etc are functions of temperature only one of the most accurate equations of state is that from benedict-webb-rubin-starling 17 shown next it was very close to a virial equation of state if the exponential term in it is expanded to two taylor terms a virial equation can be derived note that in this virial equation the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero the second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered the third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered the bwr equation

petroleum systems gulf publishing company saft equations of state edit statistical associating fluid theory saft equations of state use statistical mechanical methods in particular perturbation theory to describe the interactions between molecules in a system 18 the idea of a saft equation of state was first proposed by chapman et al in 1989 18 but since then many different saft equations of state have been proposed 19 often saft equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another 18 one popular saft equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments pc-saft 20 in general saft equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state especially for systems containing liquids or solids 21 22 multiparameter equations of state edit helmholtz function form edit multiparameter equations of state meos can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy in both the liquid and gaseous states meoss represent the helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density thus where the reduced density and temperature are typically though not always the critical values for the pure fluid other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the meos by using appropriate derivatives of the helmholtz function hence because integration of the meos is not required there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms typical meos use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters but are able to represent the fluids properties with high accuracy meos are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants mixture models also exist other equations of state of interest edit stiffened equation of state edit when considering water under very high pressures in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions sonic shock lithotripsy and sonoluminescence the stiffened equation of state is often used where is the internal energy per unit mass is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1 and is another constant representing the molecular attraction between water molecules the magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals 20000 atmospheres the equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is already under about 20000 atmospheres 2gpa pressure and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres 100kpa to 200kpa the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20001 to 20002 atmospheres 20001mpa to 20002mpa this equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks ultrarelativistic equation of state edit an ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state where is the pressure is the mass density and is the speed of sound ideal bose equation of state edit the equation of state for an ideal bose gas is where is an exponent specific to the system eg in the absence of a potential field 32 z is exp kt where is the chemical potential li is the polylogarithm is the riemann zeta function and t c is the critical
