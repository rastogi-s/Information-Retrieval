originally applied to the whole frankish empire the name france comes from the latin francia or country of the franks 21 modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm 22 the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english 23 it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation 24 another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca 25 however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around 26 history main article history of france prehistory before the 6th century bc main article

this makes it frances oldest city 29 30 at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc 31 the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and

region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french 32 julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc 33 gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces 34 many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the

northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title

occupied by and was the precursor to modern france 42 during the 9th and 10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of

to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france 44 the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt

roman empire french explorers such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomews day massacre of 1572 51 the wars of religion were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s he systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence dueling carrying weapons and maintaining private army by the end of 1620s richelieu established the royal monopoly of force as the doctrine 52 during louis xivs minority and the regency of

acquisitions such as lorraine 1766 and corsica 1770 an unpopular king louis xvs weak rule his ill-advised financial political and military decisions as well as the debauchery of his court discredited

from great britain realised in the treaty of paris 1783 the financial crisis that followed frances involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french

carrying passengers 1783 were achieved by french scientists french explorers such as bougainville and laprouse took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around

assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become frances national day in early august 1789 the national constituent assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights through the

property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth in november 1789 the assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the roman catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country in july 1790 a civil constitution of the clergy reorganised the french catholic church cancelling the authority of the church to levy taxes et cetera this fueled much discontent in parts of france which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later while king louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes june 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility in august 1791 the emperor of austria and the king of prussia in the declaration of pillnitz threatened revolutionary france to intervene by force of arms to restore the french absolute monarchy in september 1791 the national constituent assembly forced king louis xvi to accept the french constitution of 1791 thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in the newly established legislative assembly october 1791 enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the girondins who favored war with austria and prussia and a group later called montagnards or jacobins who opposed such a war but a majority in the assembly in 1792 saw a war with austria and prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that france would win a war against those gathered monarchies on 20 april 1792 therefore they declared war on austria

uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances the west of france has strictly oceanic climate cfb it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone the climate of the southwest is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier away from the coast the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat the paris sedimentary basin and more so the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter therefore most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones the semi-continental climate cfc of the north and centre-east alsace plains of the sane the middle part of the rhne dauphin auvergne and savoy the mediterranean and the lower rhne valley experience a mediterranean climate csa and csb due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting mistral

electricity production 87 and results in less pollution 88 89 like all european union members france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 of 1990 levels by the year 2020 90 compared to the us

the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law

inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public

french art the origins of french art were very much influenced by flemish art and by italian art at the time of the renaissance jean fouquet the most famous medieval french painter is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance at first hand the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino who both worked in france two of the most famous french artists of the time of baroque era nicolas poussin and claude lorrain lived in italy the 17th century was the period when french painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism louis xivs prime minister jean-baptiste colbert founded in 1648 the royal academy of painting and sculpture to protect these artists and in 1666 he created the still-active french academy in rome to have direct relations with italian artists french artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style the works of the court-endorsed artists antoine watteau franois boucher and jean-honor fragonard being the most representative in the country the french revolution brought great changes as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques-louis david and the highly influential acadmie des beaux-arts defined the style known as academism at this time france had become a centre of artistic creation the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements at first romanticism with thodore gricault and eugne delacroix and realism with camille corot gustave courbet and jean-franois millet a style that eventually evolved into naturalism in the second part of the 19th century frances influence over painting became even more important with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro douard manet edgar degas claude monet and auguste renoir 287 the second generation of impressionist-style painters paul czanne paul gauguin toulouse-lautrec and georges seurat were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions 288 as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse andr derain and maurice de vlaminck 289 290 at the beginning of the 20th century cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso living in paris other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris such as vincent van gogh marc chagall amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky many museums in france are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works a huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned muse du louvre

greatest examples of romanesque churches in france are the saint sernin basilica in toulouse the largest romanesque church in europe 294 and the remains of the cluniac abbey the gothic architecture originally named opus francigenum meaning french work 295 was born in le-de-france and was the first french style of architecture to be copied in all europe 296 northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas the first of these being the saint denis basilica used as the royal necropolis other important french gothic cathedrals are notre-dame de chartres and notre-dame damiens the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notre-dame de reims 297 aside from churches gothic architecture had been used for many religious palaces the most

renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court many residential palaces were built in the loire valley such residential castles were the chteau de chambord the chteau de chenonceau or the chteau damboise following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style however in france baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one 298 in the secular domain the palace of versailles has many baroque features jules hardouin mansart who designed the extensions to

the late 19th century gustave eiffel designed many bridges such as garabit viaduct and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time although he is best remembered for the iconic eiffel tower in the 20th century french-swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france more recently french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers as they are visible from afar for instance in paris since 1977 new buildings had to be under 37 meters 121 feet 303 frances largest financial district is la defense where a significant number of skyscrapers are located 304 other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct some famous modern french architects include jean
