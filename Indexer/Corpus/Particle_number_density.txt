particle number wikipedia particle number the particle number or number of particles of a thermodynamic system conventionally indicated with the letter n is the number of constituent particles in that system 1 the particle number is a fundamental parameter in thermodynamics which is conjugate to the chemical potential unlike most physical quantities particle number is a dimensionless quantity it is an extensive parameter as it is directly proportional to the size of the system under consideration and thus meaningful only for closed systems a constituent particle is one that cannot be broken into smaller pieces at the scale of energy kt involved in the process where k is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature for example for a thermodynamic system consisting of a piston containing water vapour the particle number is the number of water molecules in the system the meaning of constituent particle and thereby of particle number is thus temperature-dependent determining the particle number edit the concept of particle number has a main role in theoretical considerations in situations where the actual particle number of a given thermodynamical system needs to be determined mainly in chemistry it is not practically possible to measure it directly by counting the particles if the material is homogeneous and has a known amount of substance n expressed in moles the particle number n can be found by the relation n nn a where n a is the avogadro constant 1 particle number density edit a related intensive system parameter is given by the particle number density obtained by dividing the particle number of a system by its volume this parameter is often denoted by a lower-case letter n in quantum mechanics edit in quantum mechanical processes the total number of particles may not be preserved the concept is therefore generalized to the particle number operator that is the observable that counts the number of constituent particles 2 in quantum field theory the particle number operator see fock state is conjugate to the phase of the classical wave see coherent state in air quality edit one measure of air pollution used in air quality standards is the atmospheric concentration of particulate matter this measure is usually expressed in gm 3 micrograms per cubic metre in the upcoming emission norm for non-road mobile machinery a new particle number legislation is registered in this case pn expresses a quantity of particles
