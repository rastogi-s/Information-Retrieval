trace wikipedia trace for other uses see trace transition region and coronal explorer trace was a nasa heliophysics and solar observatory designed to investigate the connections between fine-scale magnetic fields and the associated plasma structures on the sun by providing high resolution images and observation of the solar photosphere the transition region and the corona a main focus of the trace instrument is the fine structure of coronal loops low in the solar atmosphere trace is the fourth spacecraft in the small explorer program launched on april 2 1998 and obtained its last science image in 2010 6 the satellite was built by nasas goddard space flight center its telescope was constructed by a consortium led by lockheed martin s advanced technology center the optics were designed and built to a state-of-the-art surface finish by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory sao the telescope has a 30cm 12in aperture and 10241024 ccd detector giving an 8.5 arc minute field of view the telescope is designed to take correlated images in a range of wavelengths from visible light through the lyman alpha line to far ultraviolet the different wavelength passbands correspond to plasma emission temperatures from 4000 to 4000000 k the optics use a special multilayer technique to focus the difficult-to-reflect euv light the technique was first used for solar imaging in the late 1980s and 1990s notably by the mssta and nixt sounding rocket payloads image gallery edit trace image of some typical million kelvin loops image of a sunspot taken by trace trace mosaic of the full-disk sun
