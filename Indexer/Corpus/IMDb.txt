approximately 4.7 million titles including episodes and 8.3 million personalities in its database 2 as well as 83 million registered users the movie and talent pages of imdb are accessible to all internet users but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site most data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors the site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast credits and other demographics of media product and personalities however image name character name plot summaries and title changes are supposedly screened before publication and usually take between 2472 hours to appear all registered users choose their own site name and most operate anonymously they have a profile page which shows how long a registered user has been a member as well as personal movie ratings should the user decide to display them and since 2015 badges are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted these badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos trivia bios etc if a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an imdb page that uservisitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in imdbpro 3 there is no single index of contributors no index on each profile page of the items contributed and excepting for plot synopses and biographies no identification of contributors to each products or persons data pages users are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10 and the totals are converted into a weighted mean rating that is displayed beside each title with online filters employed to deter ballot-stuffing history edit history before website edit imdb originated with a usenet posting by british film fan and computer programmer col needham entitled those eyes about actresses with beautiful eyes others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own needham subsequently started an actors list while dave knight began a directors list and andy krieg took over the list from hank driskill which would later be renamed the actress list both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working but soon retired people were added so needham started what was then but did not remain a separate dead actorsactresses list the goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible by late 1990 the lists included almost 10000 movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein on october 17 1990 needham developed and posted a collection of unix shell scripts which could be used to search the four lists and thus the database that would become the imdb was born 4 at the time it was known as the recartsmovies movie database on the web edit the database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia biographies and plot summaries the movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by alan jay later in 1993 it moved onto the world wide web a network in its infancy at that time under the name of cardiff internet movie database 5 the database resided on the servers of the computer science department of cardiff university in wales rob hartill was the original web interface author in 1994 the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates however the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein over the next few years the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth 6 as an independent company edit in 1996 imdb was incorporated in the united kingdom becoming the internet movie database ltd founder col needham became the primary owner as well as the figurehead general revenue for site operations was generated through advertising licensing and partnerships 7 as amazoncom subsidiary 1998present edit in 1998 jeff bezos founder owner and ceo of amazoncom struck a deal with needham and other principal shareholders to buy imdb outright for approximately 55 million 8 and attach it to amazon as a subsidiary private company 9 this gave imdb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work while amazoncom would be able to use imdb as an advertising resource for selling dvds and videotapes imdb continued to expand its functionality on january 15 2002 it added a subscription service known as imdbpro aimed at entertainment professionals imdbpro was announced and launched at the 2002 sundance film festival it provides a variety of services including film production and box office details as well as a company directory and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages with details at variance with pages about them appearing in the database as an additional incentive for users as of 2003 users identified as one of the top 100 contributors of hard data received complimentary free access to imdbpro for the following calendar year for 2006 this was increased to the top 150 contributors and for 2010 to the top 250 10 in 2008 imdb launched their first official foreign language version with the german imdbde also in 2008 imdb acquired two other companies withoutabox and box office mojo the website was originally perl based but imdb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security 11 as of may 2011 the site has been filtered in china for more than one year although many users address it through proxy server or by vpn 12 on october 17 2010 imdb launched original video wwwimdbcom20 in celebration of its 20th anniversary 13 imdbpro edit actors crew and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly fee this fee gives them membership in imdbpro imdbpro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the fee which is 19.99 usd per month or if paid annually 149.99 membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality as well as agent contact information for any actor producer director etc that has an imdb page enrolling in imdbpro for industry personnel enables those members the ability to upload a head shot to open their page as well as the ability to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page anyone can register as an imdb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content however those users enrolled in imdbpro have greater access and privileges 14 television episodes edit on january 26 2006 full episode support came online allowing the database to support separate cast and crew listings for each episode of every television series this increased the number of titles in the database from 485000 to nearly 755000 citation needed characters filmography edit on october 2 2007 citation needed the characters filmography was added character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database and as such do not need any additional verification by imdb staff they have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography instant viewing edit on september 15 2008 a feature was added that enables instant viewing of over 6000 movies and television shows from cbs sony and a number of independent film makers with direct links from their profiles 15 due to licensing restrictions this feature is available only to viewers in the united states 16 content and format edit data provided by subjects edit in 2006 imdb introduced its rsum subscription service where actors and crew can post their own rsum and upload photos of themselves 17 for a yearly fee 18 the base annual charge for including a photo with an account was 39.95 until 2010 when it was increased to 54.95 imdb rsum pages are kept on a sub-page of the regular entry about that person with a regular entry automatically created for each rsum subscriber who does not already have one 19 as of 2012 resume services is now included as part of an imdbpro subscription and is no longer offered as a separate subscription service copyright vandalism and error issues edit all volunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of imdb with the full right to copy modify and sublicense it and they are verified before posting 20 credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributors who have provided information conversely a credited text entry such as a plot summary may be corrected for content grammar sentence structure perceived omission or error by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed imdb is different from user-contributed projects like wikipedia discogs or openstreetmap in that contributors cannot add delete or modify the data or text on impulse and the manipulation of data is controlled by imdb technology and salaried staff 21 imdb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information in 2012 a spokesperson said we make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content which is why we have an edit page the data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live given the sheer volume of the information occasional mistakes are inevitable and when reported they are promptly fixed we always welcome corrections 22 the java movie database jmdb 23 is reportedly creating an imdberrorlog file that lists all the errors found while processing the imdb plain text files a wiki alternative to imdb is open media database 24 whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under cc-by and the gfdl since 2007 imdb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses parental guides and faqs about titles as determined by and answered by individual contributors data format and access edit imdb does not provide an api for automated queries however most of the data can be downloaded as compressed plain text files and the information can be extracted using the command-line interface tools provided 25 there is also a java-based graphical user interface gui application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files which allows a search and a display of the information 23 this gui application supports different languages but the movie related data are in english as made available by imdb a python package called imdbpy can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different sql databases enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining 26 film titles edit the imdb has sites in english as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages danish finnish french german hungarian italian polish portuguese spanish and romanian the non-english language sites display film titles in the specified language originally imdbs english language sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language however in 2010 imdb began allowing individual users in the uk and usa to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles or the us or uk release title normally in english ancillary features edit user ratings of films edit as one adjunct to data the imdb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten it has been alleged that the rating system is flawed for several reasons 27 imdb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a weighted mean that is displayed for each film series and so on it states that filters are used to avoid ballot stuffing the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it in fact it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean rankings edit the imdb top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described as of 30september2017 update the shawshank redemption is 1 on the list 28 the top 250 rating is based on only the ratings of regular voters the number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret imdb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the top 250 list they deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter 29 in addition to other weightings the top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula 30 this label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information in this case from eligible users who submit ratings though the current formula is not disclosed imdb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating 31 32 where weighted rating average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 mean rating number of votes for the movie votes minimum votes required to be listed in the top 250 currently 25000 the mean vote across the whole report currently 7.0 the in this formula is equivalent to a bayesian posterior mean see bayesian statistics the imdb also has a bottom 100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500 votes must be received to qualify for the list 33 the top 250 list comprises a wide range of feature films including major releases cult films independent films critically acclaimed films silent films and non-english language films short films and tv episodes are not included since 2015 there has been a top 250 list devoted to ranking television shows 34 message boards edit beginning in 2001 the internet movie database also maintained message boards for every title excepting as of 2013 tv episodes 35 and name entry along with over 140 main boards this began in 2001 in order to post on the message boards a user needed to authenticate their account via cell phone credit card or by having been a recent customer of the parent company amazoncom message boards expanded in recent years the soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects the politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics news events and current affairs as well as history and economics citation needed as of february 20 2017 all the message boards and their content have been permanently removed according to the website the decision was made because the boards were no longer providing a positive useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250 million monthly users worldwide 36 col needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads and that their members only made up a very small part of the websites visitors the boards were costly to run due to the systems age and dated design which did not make business sense 37 the decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash across the web and on social media and sparked an online petition garnering over 8000 signatures 38 in the days leading up to february 20 2017 both archiveorg 39 and moviechatorg 40 preserved the entire contents of the imdb message boards using web scraping technologies litigation edit in 2011 in the case of hoang v amazoncom imdb was sued by an anonymous actress for more than us 1000000 due to imdbs revealing her age 40 at the time 41 the actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities 42 judge marsha j pechman a us district judge in seattle dismissed the lawsuit saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint the actress re-filed and so revealed that she was huong hoang of texas who uses the stage name junie hoang 43 in 2013 pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against imdb a jury then sided with imdb on that claim 44 the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the district court judgment in march 2015 45 also in 2011 in the case of united video properties inc et al v amazoncom inc et al 46 imdb and amazon were sued by rovi corporation and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings 47 the patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to imdb and roviunited video properties lost the case though as of november 2014 it is on appeal 48 on january 1 2017 the state of california implemented state bill ab-1687 a sag-aftra backed anti-ageism statute which requires commercial online entertainment employment services to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden 49 on february 23 2017 judge vince girdhari chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial claiming that it possibly violated the first amendment because it inhibited the public consumption of factual information he also questioned the intent of the bill as it was ostensibly meant to target imdb 50 as of the beginning of 2017 imdb has received 2300 requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site included in this group were 10 academy award winners and another 71 whove been nominated for oscars emmys or golden globes 51
