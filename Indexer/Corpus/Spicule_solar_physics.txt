spicule solar physics wikipedia spicule solar physics in solar physics a spicule is a dynamic jet of about 500km diameter in the chromosphere of the sun it moves upwards at about 20kms from the photosphere they were discovered in 1877 by father angelo secchi of the observatory of roman collegium in rome description edit spicules last for about 15 minutes 1 at the solar limb they appear elongated if seen on the disk they are known as mottles or fibrils they are usually associated with regions of high magnetic flux their mass flux is about 100 times that of the solar wind they rise at a rate of 20kms or 72000kmh and can reach several thousand kilometers in height before collapsing and fading away prevalence edit there are about 300000 active spicules at any one time on the sun s chromosphere amounting to about 1 of the sun s surface 1 an individual spicule typically reaches 3000-10000km altitude above the photosphere 2 causes edit bart de pontieu lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory palo alto california united states robert erdlyi and stewart james both from the university of sheffield united kingdom hypothesised in 2004 that spicules formed as a result of p-mode oscillations in the suns surface sound waves with a period of about five minutes that causes the suns surface to rise and fall at several hundred meters per second see helioseismology magnetic flux tubes that tilted away from the vertical can focus and guide the rising material up into the solar atmosphere to form a spicule there is still however some controversy about the issue in the solar physics community
