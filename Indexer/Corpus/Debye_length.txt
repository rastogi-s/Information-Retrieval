debye length wikipedia debye length in plasmas and electrolytes the debye length also called debye radius named after the dutch physicist and physical chemist peter debye is a measure of a charge carriers net electrostatic effect in solution and how far its electrostatic effect persists a debye sphere is a volume whose radius is the debye length with each debye length charges are increasingly electrically screened every debyelength the electric potential will decrease in magnitude by 1e debye length is an important parameter in plasma physics electrolytes and colloids dlvo theory the corresponding debye screening wave vector for particles of density charge at a temperature is given by in gaussian units expressions in mks units will be given below the analogous quantities at very low temperatures are known as the thomas-fermi length and the thomas-fermi wave vector they are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature physical origin edit the debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges in a system of different species of charges the th species carries charge and has concentration at position according to the so-called primitive model these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its relative static permittivity this distribution of charges within this medium gives rise to an electric potential that satisfies poissons equation where is the electric constant and is a charge density external logically not spatially to the medium the mobile charges not only establish but also move in response to the associated coulomb force if we further assume the system to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with a heat bath at absolute temperature then the concentrations of discrete charges may be considered to be thermodynamic ensemble averages and the associated electric potential to be a thermodynamic mean field with these assumptions the concentration of the th charge species is described by the boltzmann distribution where is boltzmanns constant and where is the mean concentration of charges of species identifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in boltzmanns distribution yields the poissonboltzmann equation solutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems solutions for more general systems may be obtained in the high-temperature weak coupling limit by taylor expanding the exponential this approximation yields the linearized poisson-boltzmann equation which also is known as the debyehckel equation 1 2 3 4 5 the second term on the right-hand side vanishes for systems that are electrically neutral the term in parentheses divided by has the units of an inverse length squared and by dimensional analysis leads to the definition of the characteristic length scale that commonly is referred to as the debyehckel length as the only characteristic length scale in the debyehckel equation sets the scale for variations in the potential and in the concentrations of charged species all charged species contribute to the debyehckel length in the same way regardless of the sign of their charges for an electrically neutral system the poisson equation becomes to illustrate debye screening the potential produced by an external point charge is the bare coulomb potential is exponentially screened by the medium over a distance of the debye length the debyehckel length may be expressed in terms of the bjerrum length as where is the integer charge number that relates the charge on the th ionic species to the elementary charge typical values edit in space plasmas where the electron density is relatively low the debye length may reach macroscopic values such as in the magnetosphere solar wind interstellar medium and intergalactic medium see table hannes alfvn pointed out that in a low density plasma localized space charge regions may build up large potential drops over distances of the order of some tens of the debye lengths such regions have been called electric double layers an electric double layer is the simplest space charge distribution that gives a potential drop in the layer and a vanishing electric field on each side of the layer in the laboratory double layers have been studied for half a century but their importance in cosmic plasmas has not been generally recognized 7 in a plasma edit in a non-isothermic plasma the temperatures for electrons and heavy species may differ while the background medium may be treated as the vacuum and the debye length is where d is the debye length 0 is the permittivity of free space k b is the boltzmann constant q e is the charge of an electron t e and t i are the temperatures of the electrons and ions respectively n e is the density of electrons n j is the density of atomic species j with positive ionic charge z j q e even in quasineutral cold plasma where ion contribution virtully seems to be larger due to lower ion temperature the ion term is actually often dropped giving although this is only valid when the mobility of ions is negligible compared to the processs timescale 8 in an electrolyte solution edit in an electrolyte or a colloidal suspension the debye length 9 for a monovalent electrolyte is usually denoted with symbol 1 where i is the ionic strength of the electrolyte and here the unit should be molem 3 even though i is commonly found in mol per kg of solvent 0 is the permittivity of free space r is the dielectric constant k b is the boltzmann constant t is the absolute temperature in kelvins n a is the avogadro number is the elementary charge or for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte where r is the gas constant f is the faraday constant c 0 is the molar concentration of the electrolyte alternatively where is the bjerrum length of the medium for water at room temperature b 07nm at room temperature 25c one can consider in water the relation 10 where 1 is expressed in nanometers nm i is the ionic strength expressed in molar m or moll in semiconductors edit the debye length has become increasingly significant in the modeling of solid state devices as improvements in lithographic technologies have enabled smaller geometries 11 12 13 the debye length of semiconductors is given where is the dielectric constant k b is the boltzmanns constant t is the absolute temperature in kelvins q is the elementary charge and n d is the density of dopants either donors or acceptors when doping profiles exceed the debye length majority carriers no longer behave according to the distribution of the dopants instead a measure of the profile of the doping gradients provides an effective profile that better matches the profile of the majority carrier density in the context of solids the debye length is also called the thomasfermi screening length
