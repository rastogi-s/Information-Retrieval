solar eclipses on neptune wikipedia solar eclipses on neptune solar eclipses on neptune occur when any of the natural satellites of neptune pass in front of the sun as seen from the mother planet for bodies which appear smaller in angular diameter than the sun the proper term would be a transit for bodies which are larger than the apparent size of the sun the proper term would be an occultation all of neptunes inner moons and triton can eclipse the sun as seen from neptune all other satellites of neptune are too small andor too distant to produce an umbra from this distance the suns angular diameter is reduced to one and a quarter arcminutes across here are the angular diameters of the moons that are large enough to fully eclipse the sun naiad 713 thalassa 814 despina 1422 galatea 1318 larissa 1014 proteus 1316 triton 2628 just because the moons are large enough to fully eclipse the sun does not necessarily mean that they will do so eclipses of the sun from neptune are very rare due to the planets long orbital period and large axial tilt of 28 degrees in addition the largest moon triton has an orbital inclination of about 25 degrees to neptunes equator this makes eclipses of the sun by triton very rare even when such an eclipse does occur it passes rather quickly as triton moves in the opposite direction of neptunes spin
