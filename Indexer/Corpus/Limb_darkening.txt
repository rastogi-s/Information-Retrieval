limb darkening wikipedia limb darkening limb darkening is an optical effect seen in stars including the sun where the center part of the disk appears brighter than the edge or limb of the image its understanding offered early solar astronomers an opportunity to construct models with such gradients this encouraged the development of the theory of radiative transfer basic theory edit crucial to understanding limb darkening is the idea of optical depth a distance equal to one optical depth is the thickness of the absorbing gas from which a fraction of 1 e photons can escape this is what defines the visible edge of a star since it is at a few optical depths that the star becomes opaque the radiation reaching us is closely approximated by the sum of all the emission along the entire line of sight up to that point where the optical depth is unity in particular if the intensity of radiation in the star varies linearly with optical depth then the radiation reaching us will be of the intensity at an optical depth of unity when we look near the edge of a star we cannot see to the same depth as when we look at the center because the line of sight must travel at an oblique angle through the stellar gas when looking near the limb in other words the star radius at which we see the optical depth as being unity increases as we move our line of sight towards the limb the second effect is the fact that the effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is usually decreasing for an increasing distance from the center of the star the radiation emitted from a gas is a strong function of temperature for a black body for example the spectrally integrated intensity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature stefanboltzmann law since when we look at a star at first approximation the radiation comes from the point at which the optical depth is unity and that point is deeper in when looking at the center the temperature will be higher and the intensity will be greater than when we look at the limb in fact the temperature in the atmosphere of a star does not always decrease with increasing height and for certain spectral lines the optical depth is unity in a region of increasing temperature in this case we see the phenomenon of limb brightening for the sun the existence of a temperature minimum region means that limb brightening should start to dominate at far-infrared or radio wavelengths outside the lower atmosphere and well above the temperature-minimum region we find the million kelvin solar corona for most wavelengths this region is optically thin ie has small optical depth and must therefore be limb-brightened if spherically symmetric further complication comes from the existence of rough three-dimensional structure the classical analysis of stellar limb darkening as described below assumes the existence of a smooth hydrostatic equilibrium and at some level of precision this assumption must fail most obviously in sunspots and faculae but generally everywhere instead the boundary between the chromosphere and the corona consists of a very complicated transition region best observed at ultraviolet wavelengths only detectable from space calculation of limb darkening edit in the figure shown here as long as the observer at point p is outside the stellar atmosphere the intensity seen in the direction will be a function only of the angle of incidence this is most conveniently approximated as a polynomial in cos where i is the intensity seen at p along a line of sight forming angle with respect to the stellar radius and i 0 is the central intensity in order that the ratio be unity for 0 we must have for example for a lambertian radiator no limb darkening we will have all a k 0 except a 0 1 as another example for the sun at 550nm the limb darkening is well expressed by n 2 and see cox 2000 the equation for limb darkening is sometimes more conveniently written as which now has n independent coefficients rather than n 1 coefficients that must sum to unity the a k constants can be related to the a k constants for n 2 for the sun at 550nm we then have this model gives an intensity at the edge of the suns disk of only 30 of the intensity at the centre of the disk we can convert these formulas to functions of by using the substitution where is the angle from the observer to the limb of the star for small we have we see that the derivative of cos is infinite at the edge the above approximation can be used to derive an analytic expression for the ratio of the mean intensity to the central intensity the mean intensity i m is the integral of the intensity over the disk of the star divided by the solid angle subtended by the disk where d sindd is a solid angle element and the integrals are over the disk 0 2 and 0 we may rewrite this as although this equation can be solved analytically it is rather cumbersome however for an observer at infinite distance from the star can be replaced by so we have which gives for the sun at 550nm this says that the average intensity is 80.5 of the intensity at the centre
