retrograde and prograde motion wikipedia retrograde and prograde motion this article is about retrograde motions of celestial bodies relative to a gravitationally central object for the apparent motion as seen from a particular vantage point see apparent retrograde motion retrograde motion is motion in the direction opposite to the movement of something else and the contrary of direct or prograde motion this motion can be the orbit of one body about another body or about some other point or the rotation of a single body about its axis or other phenomena such as precession or nutation of the axis in reference to celestial systems retrograde motion usually means motion that is contrary to the rotation of the primary that is the object that forms the systems hub rotation is determined with respect to an inertial frame of reference such as distant fixed stars in our solar system all of the planets and most of the other objects that orbit the sun with the exception of many comets do so in the prograde direction ie the same sense as the rotation of the sun in addition the rotations of most planets are prograde with the exceptions of venus and uranus which have retrograde rotations most satellites of planets revolve around their planets in the prograde sense in the case of the satellites of uranus this means they revolve in the same sense as uranuss rotation which is retrograde relative to the sun there are some satellites that orbit in the retrograde sense but these are generally small and distant from their planets except for neptune s satellite triton which is large and close it is thought that these retrograde satellites including triton are bodies that have been captured into orbit around their planets having been formed elsewhere formation of celestial systems edit when a galaxy or a planetary system forms its material takes the shape of a disk most of the material orbits and rotates in one direction this uniformity of motion is due to the collapse of a gas cloud 1 the nature of the collapse is explained by the principle called conservation of angular momentum in 2010 the discovery of several hot jupiters with backward orbits called into question the theories about the formation of planetary systems 2 this can be explained by noting that stars and their planets do not form in isolation but in star clusters that contain molecular clouds when a protoplanetary disk collides with or steals material from a cloud this can result in retrograde motion of a disk and the resulting planets 3 4 orbital parameters edit inclination edit a celestial objects inclination indicates whether the objects orbit is prograde or retrograde the inclination of a celestial object is the angle between its orbital plane and another reference frame such as the equatorial plane of the objects primary in the solar system inclination of the planets is measured from the ecliptic plane which is the plane of earth s orbit around the sun 5 the inclination of moons is measured from the equator of the planet they orbit an object with an inclination between 0 and 90 degrees is orbiting or revolving in the same direction as the primary is rotating an object with an inclination of exactly 90 degrees has a perpendicular orbit that is neither prograde nor retrograde an object with an inclination between 90 degrees and 180 degrees is in a retrograde orbit axial tilt edit a celestial objects axial tilt indicates whether the objects rotation is prograde or retrograde axial tilt is the angle between an objects rotation axis and a line perpendicular to its orbital plane passing through the objects centre an object with an axial tilt up to 90 degrees is rotating in the same direction as its primary an object with an axial tilt of exactly 90 degrees has a perpendicular rotation that is neither prograde nor retrograde an object with an axial tilt between 90 degrees and 180 degrees is rotating in the opposite direction to its orbital direction planets edit all eight planets in the solar system orbit the sun in the direction that the sun is rotating which is counterclockwise when viewed from above the suns north pole six of the planets also rotate about their axis in this same direction the exceptionsthe planets with retrograde rotationare venus and uranus venuss axial tilt is 177 degrees which means it is spinning almost exactly in the opposite direction to its orbit uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77 degrees so its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the solar system the reason for uranuss unusual axial tilt is not known with certainty but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the solar system an earth-sized protoplanet collided with uranus causing the skewed orientation 6 it is unlikely that venus was formed with its present slow retrograde rotation which takes 243 days venus probably began with a fast prograde rotation with a period of several hours much like most of the planets in the solar system venus is close enough to the sun to experience significant gravitational tidal dissipation and also has a thick enough atmosphere to create thermally driven atmospheric tides that create a retrograde torque venus present slow retrograde rotation is in equilibrium balance between gravitational tides trying to tidally lock venus to the sun and atmospheric tides trying to spin venus in a retrograde direction in addition to maintaining this present day equilibrium tides are also sufficient to account for evolution of venuss rotation from a primordial fast prograde direction to its present-day slow retrograde rotation 7 in the past various other alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain venus retrograde rotation such as collisions or it having originally formed that way a mercury is closer to the sun than venus but mercury is not tidally locked because it has entered a 32 spinorbit resonance due to the eccentricity of its orbit mercurys prograde rotation is slow enough that due to its eccentricity its angular orbital velocity exceeds its angular rotational velocity near perihelion causing the motion of the sun in mercurys sky to temporarily reverse 8 the rotations of earth and mars are also affected by tidal forces with the sun but they have not reached an equilibrium state like mercury and venus because they are further out from the sun where tidal forces are weaker the gas giants of the solar system are too massive and too far from the sun for tidal forces to slow down their rotations 7 dwarf planets edit all known dwarf planets and dwarf planet candidates have prograde orbits around the sun but some have retrograde rotation pluto has retrograde rotation its axial tilt is approximately 120 degrees 9 pluto and its moon charon are both tidally locked to each other it is suspected that the plutonian satellite system was created by a massive collision 10 11 earths atmosphere edit retrograde motion or retrogression within the earths atmosphere is seen in weather systems that move from east to west through the westerlies or from west to east through the trade wind easterlies natural satellites and rings edit if formed in the gravity-field of a planet as the planet is forming a moon will orbit the planet in the same direction as the planet is rotating and is a regular moon if an object is formed elsewhere and later captured into orbit by a planets gravity it can be captured into a retrograde or prograde orbit depending on whether it first approaches the side of the planet that is rotating towards or away from it this is an irregular moon 12 in the solar system many of the asteroid-sized moons have retrograde orbits whereas all the large moons except triton the largest of neptunes moons have prograde orbits 13 the particles in saturns phoebe ring are thought to have a retrograde orbit because they originate from the irregular moon phoebe all retrograde satellites experience tidal deceleration to some degree the only satellite in the solar system for which this effect is non-negligible is neptunes moon triton all the other retrograde satellites are on distant orbits and tidal forces between them and the planet are negligible within the hill sphere the region of stability for retrograde orbits at a large distance from the primary is larger than that for prograde orbits this has been suggested as an explanation for the preponderance of retrograde moons around jupiter because saturn has a more even mix of retrogradeprograde moons however the underlying causes appear to be more complex 14 with the exception of hyperion all the known regular planetary natural satellites in the solar system are tidally locked to their host planet so they have zero rotation relative to their host planet but have the same type of rotation relative to the sun as their host planet because they have prograde orbits around their host planet that is to say they all have prograde rotation relative to the sun except those of uranus if there is a collision material could be ejected in any direction and coalesce into either prograde or retrograde moons which may be the case for the moons of dwarf planet haumea although haumeas rotation direction is not known 15 small solar system bodies edit asteroids edit asteroids usually have a prograde orbit around the sun only a few dozen asteroids in retrograde orbits are known some asteroids with retrograde orbits may be burnt-out comets 16 but some may acquire their retrograde orbit due to gravitational interactions with jupiter 17 due to their small size and their large distance from earth it is difficult to telescopically analyse the rotation of most asteroids as of 2012 data is available for less than 200 asteroids and the different methods of determining the orientation of poles often result in large discrepancies 18 the asteroid spin vector catalog at poznan observatory 19 avoids use of the phrases retrograde rotation or prograde rotation as it depends which reference plane is meant and asteroid coordinates are usually given with respect to the ecliptic plane rather than the asteroids orbital plane 20 asteroids with satellites also known as binary asteroids make up about 15 of all asteroids less than 10km in diameter in the main belt and near-earth population and most are thought to be formed by the yorp effect causing an asteroid to spin so fast that it breaks up 21 as of 2012 and where the rotation is known all satellites of asteroids orbit the asteroid in the same direction as the asteroid is rotating 22 most known objects that are in orbital resonance are orbiting in the same direction as the objects they are in resonance with however a few retrograde asteroids have been found in resonance with jupiter and saturn 23 comets edit comets from the oort cloud are much more likely than asteroids to be retrograde 16 halleys comet has a retrograde orbit around the sun 24 kuiper belt edit most kuiper belt objects have prograde orbits around the sun the first kuiper belt object discovered to have a retrograde orbit is 2008 kv 42 25 meteoroids edit meteoroids in a retrograde orbit around the sun hit the earth with a faster relative speed than prograde meteoroids and tend to burn up in the atmosphere and are more likely to hit the side of the earth facing away from the sun ie at night whereas the prograde meteoroids have slower closing speeds and more often land as meteorites and tend to hit the sun-facing side of the earth most meteoroids are prograde 26 the sun edit the suns motion about the centre of mass of the solar system is complicated by perturbations from the planets every few hundred years this motion switches between prograde and retrograde 27 exoplanets edit stars and planetary systems tend to be born in star clusters rather than forming in isolation protoplanetary disks can collide with or steal material from molecular clouds within the cluster and this can lead to disks and their resulting planets having inclined or retrograde orbits around their stars 3 4 retrograde motion may also result from gravitational interactions with other celestial bodies in the same system see kozai mechanism or a near-collision with another planet 1 or it may be that the star itself flipped over early in their systems formation due to interactions between the stars magnetic field and the planet-forming disk 28 29 the accretion disk of the protostar iras 16293-2422 has parts rotating in opposite directions this is the first known example of a counterrotating accretion disk if this system forms planets the inner planets will likely orbit in the opposite direction to the outer planets 30 wasp-17b was the first exoplanet that was discovered to be orbiting its star opposite to the direction the star is rotating 31 a second such planet was announced just a day later hat-p-7b 32 in one study more than half of all the known hot jupiters had orbits that were misaligned with the rotation axis of their parent stars with six having backwards orbits 2 the last few giant impacts during planetary formation tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet s rotation rate during the giant impact stage the thickness of a protoplanetary disk is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three dimensions this results in the axial tilt of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both prograde and retrograde spins equally probable therefore prograde spin with small axial tilt common for the solar systems terrestrial planets except for venus is not common for terrestrial planets in general 33 stars edit the pattern of stars appears fixed in the sky but that is only because they are so far away that their motion isnt visible to the naked eye actually they are orbiting the centre of the galaxy stars with a retrograde orbit are more likely to be found in the galactic halo than in the galactic disk the milky way s outer halo has many globular clusters with a retrograde orbit 34 and with a retrograde or zero rotation 35 the structure of the halo is topic of an ongoing debate several studies claimed to find a halo consisting of two distinct components 36 37 38 these studies find a dual halo with an inner more metal-rich prograde component ie stars orbit the galaxy on average with the disk rotation and a metal-poor outer retrograde rotating against the disc component however these findings have been challenged by other studies 39 40 arguing against such a duality these studies demonstrate that the observational data can be explained without a duality when employing an improved statistical analysis and accounting for measurement uncertainties the nearby kapteyns star is thought to have ended up with its high-velocity retrograde orbit around the galaxy as a result of being ripped from a dwarf galaxy that merged with the milky way 41 galaxies edit satellite galaxies edit close-flybys and mergers of galaxies within galaxy clusters can pull material out of galaxies and create small satellite galaxies in either prograde or retrograde orbits around larger galaxies 42 a galaxy called complex h which was orbiting the milky way in a retrograde direction relative to the milky ways rotation is colliding with the milky way 43 44 counter-rotating bulges edit ngc 7331 is an example of a galaxy that has a bulge that is rotating in the opposite direction to the rest of the disk probably as a result of infalling material 45 central black holes edit the center of a spiral galaxy contains at least one supermassive black hole 46 a retrograde black hole one whose spin is opposite to that of its disk spews jets much more powerful than those of a prograde black hole which may have no jet at all scientists have produced a theoretical framework for the formation and evolution of retrograde black holes based on the gap between the inner edge of an accretion disk and the black hole 47 48
