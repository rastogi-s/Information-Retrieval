supermoon wikipedia supermoon a supermoon is a full moon or a new moon that approximately coincides with the closest distance that the moon reaches to earth in its elliptic orbit resulting in a slightly larger-than-usual apparent size of the lunar disk as seen from earth 1 the technical name is the perigee syzygy of the earthmoonsun system or more simply full or new moon at perigee a the term supermoon is astrological in origin and has no precise astronomical definition 2 the real association of the moon with both oceanic and crustal tides has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions but no such link has been found 3 the opposite phenomenon an apogee syzygy has been called a micromoon 4 though this term is not as widespread as supermoon also some who do not consider new moons near perigee as supermoons occurrence edit of the possible 12 or 13 full or new moons each year usually three or four may be classified as supermoons as commonly defined the most recent supermoon occurred on january 31 2018 and the next full one will be on december 22 2018 5 the one on november 14 2016 was the closest supermoon since january 26 1948 and will not be surpassed until november 25 2034 6 the closest supermoon of the 21st century will occur on december 6 2052 7 supermoons will be the marked points nearest the bottom of the graph the oscillating nature of the distance to the full or new moon is due to the difference between the synodic and anomalistic months 5 the period of this oscillation is roughly 14 synodic months occasionally a supermoon coincides with a total lunar eclipse the most recent occurrence of this was in january 2018 and the next will be in january 2019 8 appearance edit a full moon at perigee appears roughly 14 larger in diameter than at apogee 9 many observers insist that the moon looks bigger to them this is likely due to observations shortly after sunset when moon is near the horizon and the moon illusion is at its most apparent 10 while the moons surface luminance remains the same because it is closer to the earth the illuminance is about 30 brighter than at its farthest point or apogee this is due to the inverse square law of light which changes the amount of light received on earth in inverse proportion to the distance from the moon 11 while a typical summer full moon at temperate latitudes provides only about 005-01 lux a supermoon directly overhead in the tropics could provide up to 0.36 lux 12 definitions edit the name supermoon was coined by astrologer richard nolle in 1979 in dell horoscope magazine arbitrarily defined as a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near within 90 of its closest approach to earth in a given orbit perigee in short earth moon and sun are all in a line with moon in its nearest approach to earth richard nolle 13 he came up with the name while reading strategic role of perigean spring tides in nautical history and coastal flooding published in 1976 by noaa hydrologist fergus wood 14 15 nolle never outlined why he chose 90 2 but explained in 2011 that he based calculations on 90 of the difference in lunar apsis extremes for the solar year in other words a full or new moon is considered a supermoon if where is the lunar distance at syzygy is the lunar distance at apogee and is the lunar distance at perigee 16 17 in practice there is no official or even consistent definition of how near perigee the full moon must occur to receive the supermoon label and new moons rarely receive a supermoon label sky and telescope magazine refers to full moon which comes within 223000 miles 359000km timeanddatecom prefers a definition of 360000 kilometres 220000mi earthsky uses nolles definition comparing their calculations to tables published by nolle in 2000 18 19 the term perigee-syzygy or perigee fullnew moon is preferred in the scientific community 20 perigee is the point at which the moon is closest in its orbit to the earth and syzygy is when the earth the moon and the sun are aligned which happens at every full or new moon astrophysicist fred espenak uses nolles definition but preferring the label of full moon at perigee 5 wood used the definition of a full or new moon occurring within 24 hours of perigee and also used the label perigee-syzygy 15 wood also coined the less used term proxigee where perigee and the full or new moon are separated by 10 hours or less 15 effects on earth edit nolle also claimed that the moon causes geophysical stress during the time of a supermoon there has also been media speculation that natural disasters such as the 2011 thoku earthquake and tsunami and the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami are causally linked with the 12 week period surrounding a supermoon 21 22 a large 7.5 magnitude earthquake centred 15 km north-east of culverden new zealand at 0003 nzdt on november 14 2016 also coincided with a supermoon 23 24 these claims have been refuted by scientists 25 26 27 28 scientists have confirmed that the combined effect of the sun and moon on the earths oceans the tide 29 is greatest when the moon is either new or full 30 and that during lunar perigee the tidal force is somewhat stronger 31 resulting in perigean spring tides however even at its most powerful this force is still relatively weak 32 causing tidal differences of inches at most 33
