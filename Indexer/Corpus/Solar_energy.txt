solar energy wikipedia solar energy for the academic journal see solar energy journal for the generation of electricity using solar energy see solar power solar energy is radiant light and heat from the sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating photovoltaics solar thermal energy solar architecture molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis 1 2 it is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air the large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity the united nations development programme in its 2000 world energy assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 157549837 exajoules ej this is several times larger than the total world energy consumption which was 5598ej in 2012 3 4 in 2011 the international energy agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating global warming and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 1 potential further information solar radiation about half the incoming solar energy reaches the earths surface average insolation the theoretical area of the small black dots is sufficient to supply the worlds total energy needs of 18 tw with solar power the earth receives 174 petawatts pw of incoming solar radiation insolation at the upper atmosphere 5 approximately 30 is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds oceans and land masses the spectrum of solar light at the earths surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet 6 most of the worlds population live in areas with insolation levels of 150300 wattsm or 3570 kwh m per day citation needed solar radiation is absorbed by the earths land surface oceans which cover about 71 of the globe and atmosphere warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises causing atmospheric circulation or convection when the air reaches a high altitude where the temperature is low water vapor condenses into clouds which rain onto the earths surface completing the water cycle the latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind cyclones and anti-cyclones 7 sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14c 8 by photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy which produces food wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived 9 the total solar energy absorbed by earths atmosphere oceans and land masses is approximately 3850000 exajoules ej per year 10 in 2002 this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year 11 12 photosynthesis captures approximately 3000ej per year in biomass 13 the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the earths non-renewable resources of coal oil natural gas and mined uranium combined 14 the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography time variation cloud cover and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation however the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator 4 time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb this limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells in addition land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established 4 solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world mostly depending on distance from the equator although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends all renewable energies other than geothermal power and tidal power derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the sun active solar techniques use photovoltaics concentrated solar power solar thermal collectors pumps and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties designing spaces that naturally circulate air and referencing the position of a building to the sun active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies 19 in 2000 the united nations development programme un department of economic and social affairs and world energy council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation cloud cover and the land that is usable by humans the estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 157549837ej per year see table below 4 thermal energy main article solar thermal energy solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating space heating space cooling and process heat generation 20 early commercial adaptation in 1878 at the universal exposition in paris augustin mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine but couldnt continue development because of cheap coal and other factors in 1897 frank shuman a us inventor engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants he along with his technical advisor ase ackermann and british physicist sir charles vernon boys citation needed developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 shuman built the worlds first solar thermal power station in maadi egypt between 1912 and 1913 his plant used parabolic troughs to power a 4552 kilowatts 6070 hp engine that pumped more than 22000 litres 4800impgal 5800usgal of water per minute from the nile river to adjacent cotton fields although the outbreak of world war i and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy shumans vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy 21 in 1916 shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energys utilization saying we have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun frank shuman new york times 2 july 1916 22 water heating main articles solar hot water and solar combisystem solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water in low geographical latitudes below 40degrees from 60 to 70 of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60c can be provided by solar heating systems 23 the most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors 44 and glazed flat plate collectors 34 generally used for domestic hot water and unglazed plastic collectors 21 used mainly to heat swimming pools 24 as of 2007 the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 154 thermal gigawatt gw th 25 china is the world leader in their deployment with 70gw th installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210gw th by 2020 26 israel and cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 of homes using them 27 in the united states canada and australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18gw th as of 2005 19 heating cooling and ventilation main articles solar heating thermal mass solar chimney and solar air conditioning in the united states heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems account for 30 465ejyr of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50 101ejyr of the energy used in residential buildings 28 29 solar heating cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heatheat from the sun in the case of solar energy common thermal mass materials include stone cement and water historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night however they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well the size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate daylighting and shading conditions when properly incorporated thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment 30 a solar chimney or thermal chimney in this context is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building as the chimney warms the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials 31 in a way that mimics greenhouses deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling when planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere their leaves provide shade during the summer while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter 32 since bare leafless trees shade 13 to 12 of incident solar radiation there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating 33 in climates with significant heating loads deciduous trees should not be planted on the equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability they can however be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain 34 cooking main article solar cooker solar cookers use sunlight for cooking drying and pasteurization they can be grouped into three broad categories box cookers panel cookers and reflector cookers 35 the simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by horace de saussure in 1767 36 a basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid it can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90150c 194302f 37 panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries dish trough fresnel mirrors to focus light on a cooking container these cookers reach temperatures of 315c 599f and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the sun 38 process heat main articles solar pond salt evaporation pond and solar furnace solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish trough and scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications the first commercial system was the solar total energy project step in shenandoah georgia usa where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50 of the process heating air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory this grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400kw of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401kw steam and 468kw chilled water and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage 39 evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation the use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams 40 clothes lines clotheshorses and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas in some states of the united states legislation protects the right to dry clothes 41 unglazed transpired collectors utc are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air utcs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22c 40f and deliver outlet temperatures of 4560c 113140f 42 the short payback period of transpired collectors 3 to 12years makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems 42 as of 2003 over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35000 square metres 380000sqft had been installed worldwide including an 860m 2 9300sqft collector in costa rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300m 2 14000sqft collector in coimbatore india used for drying marigolds 43 water treatment main articles solar still solar water disinfection solar desalination and solar powered desalination unit solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable the first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century arab alchemists 44 a large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the chilean mining town of las salinas 45 the plant which had solar collection area of 4700m 2 51000sqft could produce up to 22700l 5000impgal 6000usgal per day and operate for 40years 45 individual still designs include single-slope double-slope or greenhouse type vertical conical inverted absorber multi-wick and multiple effect these stills can operate in passive active or hybrid modes double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications 44 solar water disinfection sodis involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles to sunlight for several hours 46 exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions 47 it is recommended by the world health organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage 48 over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water 47 solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity a further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable 49 50 molten salt technology molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night it was demonstrated in the solar two project from 19951999 the system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99 a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity 51 52 53 the molten salt mixtures vary the most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate it is non-flammable and nontoxic and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications the salt melts at 131c 268f it is kept liquid at 288c 550f in an insulated cold storage tank the liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to 566c 1051f it is then sent to a hot storage tank this is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week 54 when electricity is needed the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbinegenerator as used in any conventional coal oil or nuclear power plant a 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank about 9.1 metres 30ft tall and 24 metres 79ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design several parabolic trough power plants in spain 55 and solar power tower developer solarreserve use this thermal energy storage concept the solana generating station in the us has six hours of storage by molten salt the mara elena plant 56 is a 400mw thermo-solar complex in the northern chilean region of antofagasta employing molten salt technology electricity production main article solar power some of the worlds largest solar power stations ivanpah csp and topaz pv solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics pv or indirectly using concentrated solar power csp csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam pv converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect solar power is anticipated to become the worlds largest source of electricity by 2050 with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption respectively 57 in 2016 after another year of rapid growth solar generated 1.3 of global power 58 commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s the 392 mw ivanpah solar power facility in the mojave desert of california is the largest solar power plant in the world other large concentrated solar power plants include the 150 mw solnova solar power station and the 100 mw andasol solar power station both in spain the 250 mw agua caliente solar project in the united states and the 221 mw charanka solar park in india are the worlds largest photovoltaic plants solar projects exceeding 1 gw are being developed but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kw which are connected to the grid using net metering andor a feed-in tariff 59 photovoltaics main article photovoltaics in the last two decades photovoltaics pv also known as solar pv has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source a solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect the first solar cell was constructed by charles fritts in the 1880s 60 in 1931 a german engineer dr bruno lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide 61 although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 of incident light into electricity both ernst werner von siemens and james clerk maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery 62 following the work of russell ohl in the 1940s researchers gerald pearson calvin fuller and daryl chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954 63 these early solar cells cost 286usdwatt and reached efficiencies of 456 64 by 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20 and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40 65 concentrated solar power see also concentrated solar power concentrating solar power csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam the concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant a wide range of concentrating technologies exists the most developed are the parabolic trough the concentrating linear fresnel reflector the stirling dish and the solar power tower various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight and is then used for power generation or energy storage 66 architecture and urban planning main articles passive solar building design and urban heat island sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history 68 advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the greeks and chinese who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth 69 the common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the sun compact proportion a low surface area to volume ratio selective shading overhangs and thermal mass 68 when these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range socrates megaron house is a classic example of passive solar design 68 the most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package 70 active solar equipment such as pumps fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance urban heat islands uhi are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment the higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment a straightforward method of counteracting the uhi effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area using these methods a hypothetical cool communities program in los angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3c at an estimated cost of us1billion giving estimated total annual benefits of us530million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings 71 agriculture and horticulture agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants techniques such as timed planting cycles tailored row orientation staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields 72 73 while sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture during the short growing seasons of the little ice age french and english farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy these walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south but over time sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight in 1699 nicolas fatio de duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the sun 74 applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water drying crops brooding chicks and drying chicken manure 43 75 more recently the technology has been embraced by vintners who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses 76 greenhouses convert solar light to heat enabling year-round production and the growth in enclosed environments of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate primitive greenhouses were first used during roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the roman emperor tiberius 77 the first modern greenhouses were built in europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad 78 greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers transport main articles solar vehicle solar-charged vehicle electric boat and solar balloon winner of the 2013 world solar challenge in australia solar electric aircraft circumnavigating the globe in 2015 development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s the world solar challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3021 kilometres 1877mi across central australia from darwin to adelaide in 1987 when it was founded the winners average speed was 67 kilometres per hour 42mph and by 2007 the winners average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour 5646mph 79 the north american solar challenge and the planned south african solar challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles 80 81 some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power such as for air conditioning to keep the interior cool thus reducing fuel consumption 82 83 in 1975 the first practical solar boat was constructed in england 84 by 1995 passenger boats incorporating pv panels began appearing and are now used extensively 85 in 1996 kenichi horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the pacific ocean and the sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the atlantic ocean in the winter of 20062007 86 there were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010 87 in 1974 the unmanned astroflight sunrise airplane made the first solar flight on 29 april 1979 the solar riser made the first flight in a solar-powered fully controlled man-carrying flying machine reaching an altitude of 40ft 12m in 1980 the gossamer penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics this was quickly followed by the solar challenger which crossed the english channel in july 1981 in 1990 eric scott raymond in 21 hops flew from california to north carolina using solar power 88 developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles uav with the pathfinder 1997 and subsequent designs culminating in the helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29524 metres 96864ft in 2001 89 the zephyr developed by bae systems is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft making a 54-hour flight in 2007 and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010 90 as of 2016 solar impulse an electric aircraft is currently circumnavigating the globe it is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power the design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days 91 a solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air as sunlight shines on the balloon the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force much like an artificially heated hot air balloon some solar balloons are large enough for human flight but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high 92 fuel production main articles solar chemical solar fuel and artificial photosynthesis solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions these processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical 93 a variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis 94 the multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels such as methanol from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons though use of water as the source of electrons as plants do requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen 95 some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system 96 another vision involves all human structures covering the earths surface ie roads vehicles and buildings doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants 97 hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells several thermochemical processes have also been explored one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures 23002600c or 42004700f 98 another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods 99 thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute of science uses a 1mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide zno at temperatures above 1200c 2200f this initial reaction produces pure zinc which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen 100 energy storage methods main articles energy storage seasonal thermal energy storage phase change material grid energy storage and v2g thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water earth and stone well-designed systems can lower peak demand shift time-of-use to off-peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements 101 102 phase change materials such as paraffin wax and glaubers salt are another thermal storage medium these materials are inexpensive readily available and can deliver domestically useful temperatures approximately 64c or 147f the dover house in dover massachusetts was the first to use a glaubers salt heating system in 1948 103 solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems the solar two project used this method of energy storage allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules 400000kwh in its 68 m storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99 104 off-grid pv systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity with grid-tied systems excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid this is handled by rolling back the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes if the net electricity use is below zero the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month 105 other approaches involve the use of two meters to measure electricity consumed vs electricity produced this is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter most standard meters accurately measure in both directions making a second meter unnecessary pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one the energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator 106 development deployment and economics further information deployment of solar power to energy grids see also cost of electricity by source and renewable energy by country beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the industrial revolution energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels the early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce however development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury in the face of the increasing availability economy and utility of coal and petroleum 107 the 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies 108 109 deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the us and the sunshine program in japan other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the us seri now nrel japan nedo and germany fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise 110 commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the united states in the 1890s 111 these systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels 112 as with photovoltaics solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20 since 1999 25 although generally underestimated solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154gw as of 2007 25 the international energy agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces 1 the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 1 in 2011 a report by the international energy agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the worlds energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change the energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters the strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications from small scale to big scale 113 we have proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun frank shuman new york times 2 july 1916 22 iso standards the international organization for standardization has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment for example iso 9050 relates to glass in building while iso 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters
