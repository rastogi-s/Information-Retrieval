solar eclipses on saturn wikipedia solar eclipses on saturn solar eclipses on saturn occur when the natural satellites of saturn pass in front of the sun as seen from saturn for bodies which appear smaller in angular diameter than the sun the proper term would be a transit for bodies which are larger than the apparent size of the sun the proper term would be an occultation seven of saturns satellites janus mimas enceladus tethys rhea dione and titan are large enough and near enough to eclipse or occult the sun or in other words to cast an umbra on saturn most of the more distant satellites besides being tiny have orbits that are strongly inclined to the plane of saturns orbit and would rarely be seen to transit at this distance the sun covers only about 3 arcminutes in the sky of saturn in comparison the seven major moons of saturn have angular diameters of 510 mimas 59 enceladus 1015 tethys 1012 dione 811 rhea 1415 titan and 12 iapetus iapetus is saturns third largest moon but is too far away to completely eclipse the sun janus a very close moon to saturn has an angular diameter of about 7 meaning that it can fully cover the sun unlike jupiter saturn has a moderate axial tilt of 26.7 degrees this means that solar eclipses on saturn are much more rare than solar eclipses on jupiter
