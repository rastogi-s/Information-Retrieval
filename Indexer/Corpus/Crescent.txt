area complemented by a gibbous shape unshaded area the crescent shape consists of a circular disk with a segment of another circle removed from its edge so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs of different diameters which intersect at two points usually in such a manner that the enclosed shape does not include the center of the original circle as such it belongs to the class of figures known as lune in planar geometry the tapering towards the points of intersection of the two arcs are known as the horns of the crescent the classical crescent shape has its horns pointing upward and is often worn as horns when worn as a crown or diadem eg in depictions of the lunar goddess or in the headdress of persian kings etc 6 the word crescent is derived etymologically from the present participle of the latin verb crescere to grow technically denoting the waxing moon luna crescens as seen from the northern hemisphere the waxing moon tends to appear with its horns pointing towards the left and conversely the waning moon with its horns pointing towards the right the english word crescent may however refer to the shape regardless of its orientation except for the technical language of blazoning used in heraldry where the word increscent refers to a crescent shape with its horns to the left and decrescent refers to one with its horns to the right while the word
