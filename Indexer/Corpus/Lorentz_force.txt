lorentz force wikipedia lorentz force in physics particularly in electromagnetism the lorentz force is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields a particle of charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of an electric field e and a magnetic field b experiences a force in si units 1 2 variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire sometimes called laplace force the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field an aspect of faradays law of induction and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near the speed of light relativistic form of the lorentz force the first derivation of the lorentz force is commonly attributed to oliver heaviside in 1889 3 although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by james clerk maxwell 4 hendrik lorentz derived it in 1895 5 a few years after heaviside equation edit charged particle edit the force f acting on a particle of electric charge q with instantaneous velocity v due to an external electric field e and magnetic field b is given by in si units 1 6 where is the vector cross product all boldface quantities are vectors in terms of cartesian components we have in general the electric and magnetic fields are functions of the position and time therefore explicitly the lorentz force can be written as in which r is the position vector of the charged particle t is time and the overdot is a time derivative a positively charged particle will be accelerated in the same linear orientation as the e field but will curve perpendicularly to both the instantaneous velocity vector v and the b field according to the right-hand rule in detail if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of v and are then curled to point in the direction of b then the extended thumb will point in the direction of f the term q e is called the electric force while the term q v b is called the magnetic force 7 according to some definitions the term lorentz force refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force 8 with the total electromagnetic force including the electric force given some other nonstandard name this article will not follow this nomenclature in what follows the term lorentz force will refer to the expression for the total force the magnetic force component of the lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field in that context it is also called the laplace force the lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle that is it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle that power is notice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle continuous charge distribution edit for a continuous charge distribution in motion the lorentz force equation becomes where d f is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge dq if both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution dv the result is where f is the force density force per unit volume and is the charge density charge per unit volume next the current density corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is so the continuous analogue to the equation is 9 the total force is the volume integral over the charge distribution by eliminating and j using maxwells equations and manipulating using the theorems of vector calculus this form of the equation can be used to derive the maxwell stress tensor in turn this can be combined with the poynting vector s to obtain the electromagnetic stressenergy tensor t used in general relativity 9 in terms of and s another way to write the lorentz force per unit volume is 9 where c is the speed of light and denotes the divergence of a tensor field rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields this equation relates the energy flux flow of energy per unit time per unit distance in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution see covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details the density of power associated with the lorentz force in a material medium is if we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts we get that the density of the lorentz force is where f is the density of free charge p is the polarization density j f is the density of free current and m is the magnetization density in this way the lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field the density of the associated power is equation in cgs units edit the above-mentioned formulae use si units which are the most common among experimentalists technicians and engineers in cgs-gaussian units which are somewhat more common among theoretical physicists one has instead where c is the speed of light although this equation looks slightly different it is completely equivalent since one has the following relations 1 where 0 is the vacuum permittivity and 0 the vacuum permeability in practice the subscripts cgs and si are always omitted and the unit system has to be assessed from context history edit trajectory of a particle with a positive or negative charge q under the influence of a magnetic field b which is directed perpendicularly out of the screen beam of electrons moving in a circle due to the presence of a magnetic field purple light is emitted along the electron path due to the electrons colliding with gas molecules in the bulb a teltron tube is used in this example charged particles experiencing the lorentz force early attempts to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force were made in the mid-18th century it was proposed that the force on magnetic poles by johann tobias mayer and others in 1760 10 and electrically charged objects by henry cavendish in 1762 11 obeyed an inverse-square law however in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive it was not until 1784 when charles-augustin de coulomb using a torsion balance was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true 12 soon after the discovery in 1820 by h c rsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current andr-marie ampre that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements 13 14 in all these descriptions the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields 15 the modern concept of electric and magnetic fields first arose in the theories of michael faraday particularly his idea of lines of force later to be given full mathematical description by lord kelvin and james clerk maxwell 16 from a modern perspective it is possible to identify in maxwells 1865 formulation of his field equations a form of the lorentz force equation in relation to electric currents 4 however in the time of maxwell it was not evident how his equations related to the forces on moving charged objects j j thomson was the first to attempt to derive from maxwells field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the objects properties and external fields interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in cathode rays thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as 3 thomson derived the correct basic form of the formula but because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the displacement current included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula oliver heaviside invented the modern vector notation and applied it to maxwells field equations he also in 1885 and 1889 had fixed the mistakes of thomsons derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object 3 17 18 finally in 1895 5 19 hendrik lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields lorentz began by abandoning the maxwellian descriptions of the ether and conduction instead lorentz made a distinction between matter and the luminiferous aether and sought to apply the maxwell equations at a microscopic scale using heavisides version of the maxwell equations for a stationary ether and applying lagrangian mechanics see below lorentz arrived at the correct and complete form of the force law that now bears his name 20 21 trajectories of particles due to the lorentz force edit main article guiding center in many cases of practical interest the motion in a magnetic field of an electrically charged particle such as an electron or ion in a plasma can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center and a relatively slow drift of this point the drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states masses or temperatures possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation significance of the lorentz force edit while the modern maxwells equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields the lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge q in the presence of electromagnetic fields 6 22 the lorentz force law describes the effect of e and b upon a point charge but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces notably gravity and nuclear forces thus maxwells equations do not stand separate from other physical laws but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities the response of a point charge to the lorentz law is one aspect the generation of e and b by currents and charges is another in real materials the lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles both in principle and as a matter of computation the charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the e and b fields but also generate these fields complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges for example the boltzmann equation or the fokkerplanck equation or the navierstokes equations for example see magnetohydrodynamics fluid dynamics electrohydrodynamics superconductivity stellar evolution an entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed see for example greenkubo relations and greens function many-body theory lorentz force law as the definition of e and b edit in many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism the lorentz force law is used as the definition of the electric and magnetic fields e and b 23 24 25 to be specific the lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement the electromagnetic force f on a test charge at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge q and velocity v which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors e and b in the functional form this is valid even for particles approaching the speed of light that is magnitude of v v c 26 so the two vector fields e and b are thereby defined throughout space and time and these are called the electric field and magnetic field the fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force as a definition of e and b the lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle as opposed to the hypothetical test charge of infinitesimally-small mass and charge would generate its own finite e and b fields which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences in addition if the charge experiences acceleration as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion see for example bremsstrahlung and synchrotron light these effects occur through both a direct effect called the radiation reaction force and indirectly by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents moreover net force must include gravity electroweak and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force force on a current-carrying wire edit when a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field each of the moving charges which comprise the current experiences the lorentz force and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire sometimes called the laplace force citation needed by combining the lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current the following equation results in the case of a straight stationary wire where is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire and whose direction is along the wire aligned with the direction of conventional current flow i if the wire is not straight but curved the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each infinitesimal segment of wire d then adding up all these forces by integration formally the net force on a stationary rigid wire carrying a steady current i is this is the net force in addition there will usually be torque plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid one application of this is ampres force law which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other since each experiences a lorentz force from the others magnetic field for more information see the article ampres force law emf edit the magnetic force q v b component of the lorentz force is responsible for motional electromotive force or motional emf the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators when a conductor is moved through a magnetic field the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire and this creates the emf the term motional emf is applied to this phenomenon since the emf is due to the motion of the wire in other electrical generators the magnets move while the conductors do not in this case the emf is due to the electric force q e term in the lorentz force equation the electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field resulting in an induced emf as described by the maxwellfaraday equation one of the four modern maxwells equations 27 both of these emfs despite their apparently distinct origins are described by the same equation namely the emf is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the wire this is faradays law of induction see below einsteins special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects 27 in fact the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field and in moving from one inertial frame to another the solenoidal vector field portion of the e field can change in whole or in part to a b field or vice versa 28 lorentz force and faradays law of induction edit main article faradays law of induction given a loop of wire in a magnetic field faradays law of induction states the induced electromotive force emf in the wire is where is the magnetic flux through the loop b is the magnetic field t is a surface bounded by the closed contour t at all at time t d a is an infinitesimal vector area element of t magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface direction is orthogonal to that surface patch the sign of the emf is determined by lenzs law note that this is valid for not only a stationary wire but also for a moving wire from faradays law of induction that is valid for a moving wire for instance in a motor and the maxwell equations the lorentz force can be deduced the reverse is also true the lorentz force and the maxwell equations can be used to derive the faraday law let t be the moving wire moving together without rotation and with constant velocity v and t be the internal surface of the wire the emf around the closed path t is given by 29 where is the electric field and d is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour t nb both d and d a have a sign ambiguity to get the correct sign the right-hand rule is used as explained in the article kelvinstokes theorem the above result can be compared with the version of faradays law of induction that appears in the modern maxwells equations called here the maxwellfaraday equation the maxwellfaraday equation also can be written in an integral form using the kelvinstokes theorem 30 so we have the maxwell faraday equation and the faraday law the two are equivalent if the wire is not moving using the leibniz integral rule and that div b 0 results in and using the maxwell faraday equation since this is valid for any wire position it implies that faradays law of induction holds whether the loop of wire is rigid and stationary or in motion or in process of deformation and it holds whether the magnetic field is constant in time or changing however there are cases where faradays law is either inadequate or difficult to use and application of the underlying lorentz force law is necessary see inapplicability of faradays law if the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field the magnetic flux b linking the loop can change in several ways for example if the b field varies with position and the loop moves to a location with different b field b will change alternatively if the loop changes orientation with respect to the b field the b d a differential element will change because of the different angle between b and d a also changing b as a third example if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform time-independent b field and another portion of the circuit is held stationary the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuits component parts with time surface t time-dependent in all three cases faradays law of induction then predicts the emf generated by the change in b note that the maxwell faradays equation implies that the electric field e is non conservative when the magnetic field b varies in time and is not expressible as the gradient of a scalar field and not subject to the gradient theorem since its rotational is not zero 29 31 lorentz force in terms of potentials edit see also mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field maxwells equations and helmholtz decomposition the e and b fields can be replaced by the magnetic vector potential a and scalar electrostatic potential by where is the gradient is the divergence is the curl the force becomes and using an identity for the triple product simplifies to using the chain rule the total derivative of a is so the above expression can be rewritten as which can take the convenient eulerlagrange form lorentz force and analytical mechanics edit see also momentum the lagrangian for a charged particle of mass m and charge q in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its energy rather than the force exerted on it the classical expression is given by 32 where a and are the potential fields as above using lagranges equations the equation for the lorentz force can be obtained the potential energy depends on the velocity of the particle so the force is velocity dependent so it is not conservative the relativistic lagrangian is the action is the relativistic arclength of the path of the particle in space time minus the potential energy contribution plus an extra contribution which quantum mechanically is an extra phase a charged particle gets when it is moving along a vector potential relativistic form of the lorentz force edit covariant form of the lorentz force edit field tensor edit main articles covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism and mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field using the metric signature 1 1 1 1 the lorentz force for a charge q can be written in 33 covariant form where p is the four-momentum defined as the proper time of the particle f the contravariant electromagnetic tensor and u is the covariant 4-velocity of the particle defined as in which is the lorentz factor the fields are transformed to a frame moving with constant relative velocity by where is the lorentz transformation tensor translation to vector notation edit the 1 component x component of the force is substituting the components of the covariant electromagnetic tensor f yields using the components of covariant four-velocity yields the calculation for 2 3 force components in the y and z directions yields similar results so collecting the 3 equations into one and since differentials in coordinate time dt and proper time d are related by the lorentz factor so we arrive at this is precisely the lorentz force law however it is important to note that p is the relativistic expression lorentz force in spacetime algebra sta edit the electric and magnetic fields are dependent on the velocity of an observer so the relativistic form of the lorentz force law can best be exhibited starting from a coordinate-independent expression for the electromagnetic and magnetic fields and an arbitrary time-direction this can be settled through space-time algebra or the geometric algebra of space-time a type of cliffords algebra defined on a pseudo-euclidean space 34 as and is a space-time bivector an oriented plane segment just like a vector is an oriented line segment which has six degrees of freedom corresponding to boosts rotations in space-time planes and rotations rotations in space-space planes the dot product with the vector pulls a vector in the space algebra from the translational part while the wedge-product creates a trivector in the space algebra who is dual to a vector which is the usual magnetic field vector the relativistic velocity is given by the time-like changes in a time-position vector where which shows our choice for the metric and the velocity is the proper invariant is an inadequate term because no transformation has been defined form of the lorentz force law is simply note that the order is important because between a bivector and a vector the dot product is anti-symmetric upon a space time split like one can obtain the velocity and fields as above yielding the usual expression lorentz force in general relativity edit in the general theory of relativity the equation of motion for a particle with mass and charge moving in a space with metric tensor and electromagnetic field is given as where is taken along the trajectory and the equation can also be written as where is the christoffel symbol of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity or as where is the covariant differential in general relativity metric torsion-free
