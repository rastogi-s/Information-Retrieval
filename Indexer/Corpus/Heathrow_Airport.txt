london 3 near the south end of the london borough of hillingdon on a parcel of land that is designated part of the metropolitan green belt the airport is surrounded by the villages of harlington harmondsworth longford and cranford to the north and by hounslow and hatton to the east to the south lie bedfont and stanwell while to the west heathrow is separated from slough in berkshire by the m25 motorway heathrow falls entirely under the twickenham postcode area with the postcode tw6 as the airport is located west of london and as its runways run eastwest an airliners landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of london when the wind is from the west which is the majority of the time along with gatwick stansted luton southend and london city heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the london area although only heathrow and london city are within greater london history edit for a chronicled history of heathrow airport see history of heathrow airport heathrow airport originated in 1929 as a small airfield great west aerodrome on land south-east of the hamlet of heathrow from which the airport takes its name at that time there were farms market gardens and orchards there there was a heathrow farm about where terminal 1 is now a heathrow hall and a heathrow house this hamlet was largely along a country lane heathrow road which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area development of the whole heathrow area as a very much larger airport began in 1944 it was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the far east but by the time the airfield was nearing completion world war ii had ended the government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport it opened as london airport in 1946 and was renamed heathrow airport in 1966 the masterplan clarification needed for the airport was designed by sir frederick gibberd who designed the original terminals and central area buildings including the original control tower and the multi-faith chapel of st georges operations edit facilities edit heathrow airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries the airport is the primary hub of british airways and is a base for virgin atlantic it has four passenger terminals numbered 2 to 5 and a cargo terminal of heathrows 734million passengers in 2014 93 were international travellers the remaining 7 were bound for or arriving from places in the uk 9 the busiest single destination in passenger numbers is new york with over 3million passengers flying between heathrow and jfk airport in 2013 10 in the 1950s heathrow had six runways arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a hexagram with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field two of its runways would always be within 30 of the wind direction as the required length for runways has grown heathrow now has only two parallel runways running eastwest these are extended versions of the two eastwest runways from the original hexagram from the air almost all of the original runways can still be seen incorporated into the present system of taxiways north of the northern runway and the former taxiway and aprons now the site of extensive car parks is the entrance to the access tunnel and the site of heathrows unofficial gate guardian for many years the home of a 40 scale model of a british airways concorde g-conc the site has been occupied by a model of an emirates airbus a380 since 2008 11 heathrow airport has anglican catholic free church hindu jewish muslim and sikh chaplains there is a multi-faith prayer room and counselling room in each terminal in addition to st georges interdenominational chapel in an underground vault adjacent to the old control tower where christian services take place the chaplains organize and lead prayers at certain times in the prayer room 12 the airport has its own resident press corps consisting of six photographers and one tv crew serving all the major newspapers and television stations around the world 13 most of heathrows internal roads are initial letter coded by area n in the north eg newall road e in the east eg elmdon road s in the south eg stratford road w in the west eg walrus road c in the centre eg camborne road flight movements edit aircraft destined for heathrow are usually routed over one of four main reporting points bovingdon bnn in hertfordshire lambourne lam in essex biggin hill big in bromley and ockham ock in surrey 14 each is defined by a vor radio-navigational beacon when the airport is busy aircraft orbit in the associated hold patterns these holding areas lie to the northwest northeast southeast and southwest of the london conurbation aircraft hold between 7000 feet and 15000 feet at 1000 foot intervals if these holds become full aircraft are held at more distant points before being cleared onward to one of the four main holds air traffic controllers at heathrow approach control based in swanwick hampshire then guide the aircraft to their final approach merging aircraft from the four holds into a single stream of traffic sometimes as close as 2.5 nautical miles 46km 29mi apart considerable use is made of continuous descent approach techniques to minimize the environmental effects of incoming aircraft particularly at night 15 once an aircraft is established on its final approach control is handed over to heathrow tower when runway alternation was introduced aircraft generated significantly more noise on departure than when landing so a preference for westerly operations during daylight was introduced which continues to this day 16 in this mode aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over london thereby minimizing the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas heathrows two runways generally operate in segregated mode whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other to further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes the use of runways 27r and 27l is swapped at 1500 each day if the wind is from the west when landings are easterly there is no alternation 09l remains the landing runway and 09r the departure runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded cranford agreement pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed occasionally landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal reducing taxi times night-time flights at heathrow are subject to restrictions between 2300 and 0400 the noisiest aircraft rated qc 8 and qc16 cannot be scheduled for operation in addition during the night quota period 23300600 there are four limits a limit on the number of flights allowed a quota count system which limits the total amount of noise permitted but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes 17 qc4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation a voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 0430 a trial of noise relief zones ran from december 2012 to march 2013 which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out the zones used alternated weekly meaning residents in the no-fly areas received respite from aircraft noise for set periods 18 however it was concluded that some residents in other areas experienced a significant disbenefit as a result of the trial and that it should therefore not be taken forward in its current form heathrow received more than 25000 noise complaints in just three months over the summer of 2016 but around half were made by the same ten people 19 regulation edit further information landing slot until it was required to sell gatwick and stansted airports heathrow airport holdings held a dominant position in the london aviation market and has been heavily regulated by the civil aviation authority caa as to how much it can charge airlines to land the annual increase in landing charge per passenger was capped at inflation minus 3 until 1 april 2003 from 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5 per year taking the fee to 928 per passenger in 2007 in march 2008 the caa announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5 to 1280 from 1 april 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5 for each of the following four years 20 in april 2013 the caa announced a proposal for heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3 continuing until 2019 21 whilst the cost of landing at heathrow is determined by the caa and heathrow airport holdings the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by airport co-ordination limited acl 22 until 2008 air traffic between heathrow and the united states was strictly governed by the countries bilateral bermuda ii treaty the treaty originally allowed only british airways pan am and twa to fly from heathrow to the us in 1991 paa and twa sold their rights to united airlines and american airlines respectively while virgin atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes the bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the right of establishment of the united kingdom in relation to its eu membership and as a consequence the uk was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004 a new open skies agreement was signed by the united states and the european union on 30 april 2007 and came into effect on 30 march 2008 shortly afterwards additional us airlines including northwest airlines continental airlines us airways and delta air lines started services to heathrow the airport has been criticized in recent years for overcrowding and delays 23 according to heathrow airport holdings heathrows facilities were originally designed to accommodate 55 million passengers annually the number of passengers using the airport reached a record 70 million in 2012 24 in 2007 the airport was voted the worlds least favorite alongside chicago ohare in a tripadvisor survey 25 however the opening of terminal 5 in 2008 has relieved some pressure on terminal facilities increasing the airports terminal capacity to 90million passengers per year a tie-up is also in place with mclaren applied technologies to optimize the general procedure reducing delays and pollution 26 with only two runways operating at over 98 of their capacity heathrow has little room for more flights although the increasing use of larger aircraft such as the airbus a380 will allow some increase in passenger numbers it is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport or for new airlines to start operations 27 to increase the number of flights heathrow airport holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in mixed mode whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway this would increase the airports capacity from its current 480000 movements per year to as many as 550000 according to british airways ceo willie walsh 28 heathrow airport holdings has also proposed building a third runway to the north of the airport which would significantly increase traffic capacity see future expansion below 29 security edit policing of the airport is the responsibility of the aviation security unit of the metropolitan police

expansion of heathrow airport in january 2009 the transport secretary at the time geoff hoon announced that the british government supported the expansion of heathrow by building a third 2200-metre 7200ft runway and a sixth terminal building 143 this decision followed the 2003 white paper on the future of air transport in the uk 144 and a public consultation in november 2007 145 this was a controversial decision which met with widespread opposition because of the expected greenhouse gas emissions impact on local communities as well as noise and air pollution concerns 146 prior to the 2010 general election the conservative and liberal democrat parties announced that they would prevent the construction of any third runway or further material expansion of the airports operating capacity the mayor of london then boris johnson took the position that london needs more airport capacity favouring the construction of an entirely new airport in the thames estuary rather than expanding heathrow 147 after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power it was announced that the third runway expansion was cancelled 148 two years later leading conservatives were reported to have changed their minds on the subject 149 another proposal for expanding heathrows capacity was the heathrow hub which aims to extend both runways to a total length of about 7000 metres and divide them into four so that they each provide two full length runways allowing simultaneous take-offs and landings while decreasing noise levels 150 151 in july 2013 the airport submitted three new proposals for expansion to the airports commission which was established to review airport capacity in the southeast of england the airports commission was chaired by sir howard davies who at the time of his appointment was in the employ of gic private limited formerly known as government investment corporation of singapore and a member of its international advisory board gic private limited was then 2012 as it remains today one of heathrows principal owners sir howard davies resigned these positions upon confirmation of his appointment to lead the airports commission although it has been observed that he failed to identify these interests when invited to complete the airports commissions register of interests each of the three proposals that were to be considered by sir howard daviess commission involved the construction of a third runway either to the north northwest or southwest of the airport 152 the commission released its interim report in december 2013 shortlisting three options the north-west third runway option at heathrow extending an existing runway at heathrow and a second runway at gatwick airport after this report was published the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport expansion in the south-east and that a new runway would not be built at heathrow before 2015 153 the full report was published on 1 july 2015 and backed a third north-west runway at heathrow 154 reaction to the report was generally negative particularly from london mayor boris johnson one senior conservative told channel 4 howard davies has dumped an utter steaming pile of poo on the prime ministers desk 155 on 25 october 2016 the government confirmed that heathrow would be allowed to build a third runway however a final decision would not be taken until winter of 201718 after consultations and government votes the earliest opening year would be 2025 heathrow railway hub edit a plan to make heathrow an international railway exchange has also

phase 1 phase 2 of the plans for hs2 in march 2015 158 airtrack edit in july 2009 heathrow airport limited submitted an application to the secretary of state for transport seeking to gain authorisation to develop a new rail link to heathrow terminal 5 to be known as heathrow airtrack 159 the rail link would address the current lack of public transport available to the south west of the airport by connecting to guildford reading and london waterloo baa stated that the scheme should add significantly to its aim of increasing the proportion of people using public transport to travel to the airport 160 in april 2011 baa announced that it was abandoning the project 161 citing the unavailability of government subsidy and other priorities for heathrow 162 such as linking to crossrail and hs2 heathrowgatwick rail link edit main article heathwick in late 2011 the department for transport began studying the feasibility of a high-speed rail link between gatwick and heathrow airport this rail link would form part of a plan to combine the uks two biggest airports into a collective or virtual hub dubbed heathwick the scheme envisages a 35-mile 56km high-speed rail route linking the two airports in fifteen minutes with trains travelling at a top speed of 180 miles per hour 290kmh parallel to the m25 and passengers passing through immigration or check-in only once 163 heathrow
