set up a printing house on the site of what became the senate house lawn a few yards from where the presss bookshop now stands in those days the stationers company in london jealously guarded its monopoly of printing which partly explains the delay between the date of the universitys letters patent and the printing of the first book in 1591 thomass successor john legate printed the first cambridge bible an octavo edition of the popular geneva bible the london stationers objected strenuously claiming that they had the monopoly on bible printing the universitys response was to point out the provision in its charter to print all manner of books thus began the presss tradition of publishing the bible a tradition that has endured for over four centuries beginning with the geneva bible and continuing with the authorized version the revised version the new english bible and the revised english bible the restrictions and compromises forced upon cambridge by the dispute with the london stationers did not really come to an end until the scholar richard bentley was given the power to set up a new-style press in 1696 in july 1697 the duke of somerset made a loan of 200 to the university towards the printing house and presse and james halman registrary of the university lent 100 for the same purpose 7 it was in bentleys time in 1698 that a body of senior scholars the curators known from 1733 as the syndics was appointed to be responsible to the university for the presss affairs the press syndicates publishing committee still meets regularly eighteen times a year and its role still includes the review and approval of the presss planned output john baskerville became university printer in the mid-eighteenth century baskervilles concern was the production of the finest possible books using his own type-design and printing techniques baskerville wrote the importance of the work demands all my attention not only for my own eternal reputation but i hope also to convince the world that the university in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours caxton would have found nothing to surprise him if he had walked into the presss printing house in the eighteenth century all the type was still being set by hand wooden presses capable of producing only 1000 sheets a day at best were still in use and books were still being individually bound by hand a technological breakthrough was badly needed and it came when lord stanhope perfected the making of stereotype plates this involved making a mould of the whole surface of a page of type and then casting plates from that mould the press was the first to use this technique and in 1805 produced the technically successful and much-reprinted cambridge stereotype bible by the 1850s the press was using steam-powered machine presses employing two to three hundred people and occupying several buildings in the silver street and mill lane area including the one that the press still occupies the pitt building 1833 which was built specifically for the press and in honour of william pitt the younger under the stewardship of c j clay who was university printer from 1854 to 1882 the press increased the size and scale of its academic and educational publishing operation an important factor in this increase was the inauguration of its list of schoolbooks including what came to be known as the pitt press series during clays administration the press also undertook a sizeable co-publishing venture with oxford the revised version of the bible which was begun in 1870 and completed in 1885 it was in this period as well that the syndics of the press turned down what later became the oxford english dictionary a proposal for which was brought to cambridge by james murray lexicographer before he turned to oxford the appointment of r t wright as secretary of the press syndicate in 1892 marked the beginning of the presss development as a modern publishing business with a clearly defined editorial policy and administrative structure it was wright with two great historians lord acton and f w maitland who devised the plan for one of the most distinctive cambridge contributions
