important role in some other religious traditions such as buddhism confucianism and taoism christian theology edit main article supernatural order in catholic theology the supernatural order is according to new advent defined as the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by god for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a god-like life and destiny 50 the modern catholic dictionary defines it as the sum total of heavenly destiny and all the divinely established means of reaching that destiny which surpass the mere powers and capacities of human nature 51 process theology edit main article process theology process theology is a school of thought influenced by the metaphysical process philosophy of alfred north whitehead 18611947 and further developed by charles hartshorne 18972000 it is not possible in process metaphysics to conceive divine activity as a supernatural intervention into the natural order of events process theists usually regard the distinction between the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo in process thought there is no such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is supernatural on the other hand if the natural is defined more neutrally as what is in the nature of things then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as the creative activity of actual entities in whiteheads words it lies in the nature of things that the many enter into complex unity whitehead 1978 21 it is tempting to emphasize process theisms denial of the supernatural and thereby highlight that the processed god cannot do in comparison what the traditional god could do that is to bring something from nothing in fairness however equal stress should be placed on process theisms denial of the natural as traditionally conceived so that one may highlight what the creatures cannot do in traditional theism in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics that is to be part creators of the world with god 52 donald viney process theism in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy spirit edit main articles spirit and spirituality a spirit is a supernatural being often but not exclusively a non-physical entity such as a ghost fairy or angel 53 the concepts of a persons spirit and soul often also overlap as both are either contrasted with or given ontological priority over the body and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions 54 and spirit can also have the sense of ghost ie a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person in english bibles the spirit with a capital s specifically denotes the holy spirit spirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or personality historically it was also used to refer to a subtle as opposed to gross material substance as in the famous last paragraph of sir isaac newton s principia mathematica 55 demon edit a demon from koine greek daimnion is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent in religion occultism literature fiction mythology and folklore in ancient near eastern religions as well as in the abrahamic traditions including ancient and medieval christian demonology a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity below the heavenly planes 56 which may cause demonic possession calling for an exorcism in western occultism and renaissance magic which grew out of an amalgamation of greco-roman magic jewish aggadah and christian demonology 57 a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled magic edit main article magic paranormal magic or sorcery is the use of rituals symbols actions gestures or language with the aim of utilizing supernatural forces 58 59 67 60 61 24 belief in and practice of magic has been present since the earliest human cultures and continues to have an important spiritual religious and medicinal role in many cultures today the term magic has a variety of meanings and there is no widely agreed upon definition of what it is scholars of religion have defined magic in different ways one approach associated with the anthropologists edward tylor and james g frazer suggests that magic and science are opposites an alternative approach associated with the sociologists marcel mauss and emile durkheim argues that magic takes place in private while religion is a communal and organised activity many scholars of religion have rejected the utility of the term magic and it has become increasingly unpopular within scholarship since the 1990s the term magic comes from the old persian magu a word that applied to a form of religious functionary about which little is known during the late sixth and early fifth centuries bce this term was adopted into ancient greek where it was used with negative connotations to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent unconventional and dangerous this meaning of the term was then adopted by latin in the first century bce the concept was then incorporated into christian theology during the first century ce where magic was associated with demons and thus defined against religion this concept was pervasive throughout the middle ages although in the early modern period italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to establish the idea of natural magic both negative and positive understandings of the term were retained in western culture over the following centuries with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word throughout history there have been examples of individuals who practiced magic and referred to themselves as magicians this trend has proliferated in the modern period with a growing number of magicians appearing within the esoteric milieu not verified in body british esotericist aleister crowley described magic as the art of effecting change in accordance with will miracle edit main article miracle a miracle is an event not explicable by natural or scientific laws 62 such an event may be attributed to a supernatural being a deity magic a miracle worker a saint or a religious leader informally the word miracle is often used to characterise any beneficial event that is statistically unlikely but not contrary to the laws of nature such as surviving a natural disaster or simply a wonderful occurrence regardless of likelihood such as a birth other such miracles might be survival of an illness diagnosed as terminal escaping a life-threatening situation or beating the odds some coincidences may be seen as miracles 63 a true miracle would by definition be a non-natural phenomenon leading many rational and scientific thinkers to dismiss them as physically impossible that is requiring violation of established laws of physics within their domain of validity or impossible to confirm by their nature because all possible physical mechanisms can never be ruled out the former position is expressed for instance by thomas jefferson and the latter by david hume theologians typically say that with divine providence god regularly works through nature yet as a creator is free to work without above or against it as well the possibility and probability of miracles are then equal to the possibility and probability of the existence of god 64 skepticism edit main article skepticism skepticism american english or scepticism british english see spelling differences is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of putative knowledge or belief 65 66 it is often directed at domains such as the supernatural morality moral skepticism religion skepticism about the existence of god or knowledge skepticism about the possibility of knowledge or of certainty 67 formally skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy particularly epistemology although it can be applied to any topic such as politics religion and pseudoscience epistemology and metaphysics edit see also anthropology of religion the metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis the natural will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected one complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of natural and the limits of naturalism concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism for sometimes we use the word nature for that author of nature whom the schoolmen harshly enough call natura naturans as when it is said that nature hath made man partly corporeal and partly immaterial sometimes we mean by the nature of a thing the essence or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the quiddity of a thing namely the attribute or attributes on whose score it is what it is whether the thing be corporeal or not as when we attempt to define the nature of an angle or of a triangle or of a fluid body as such sometimes we take nature for an internal principle of motion as when we say that a stone let fall in the air is by nature carried towards the centre of the earth and on the contrary that fire or flame does naturally move upwards toward heaven sometimes we understand by nature the established course of things as when we say that nature makes the night succeed the day nature hath made respiration necessary to the life of men sometimes we take nature for an aggregate of powers belonging to a body especially a living one as when physicians say that nature is strong or weak or spent or that in such or such diseases nature left to herself will do the cure sometimes we take nature for the universe or system of the corporeal works of god as when it is said of a phoenix or a chimera that there is no such thing in nature ie in the world and sometimes too and that most commonly we would express by nature a semi-deity or other strange kind of being such as this discourse examines the notion of and besides these more absolute acceptions if i may so call them of the word nature it has divers others more relative as nature is wont to be set or in opposition or contradistinction to other things as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a natural motion but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is violent so chemists distinguish vitriol into natural and fictitious or made by art ie by the intervention of human power or skill so it is said that water kept suspended in a sucking pump is not in its natural place as that is which is stagnant in the well we say also that wicked men are still in the state of nature but the regenerate in a state of grace that cures wrought by medicines are natural operations but the miraculous ones wrought by christ and his apostles were supernatural 68 robert boyle a free enquiry into the vulgarly received notion of nature the term supernatural is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics 69 epistemologically the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that ex hypothesi violate the laws of nature in so far as such laws are realistically accountable parapsychologists use the term psi to refer to an assumed unitary force underlying the phenomena they study psi is defined in the journal of parapsychology as personal factors or processes in nature which transcend accepted laws 1948 311 and which are non-physical in nature 1962310 and it is used to cover both extrasensory perception esp an awareness of or response to an external event or influence not apprehended by sensory means 1962309 or inferred from sensory knowledge and psychokinesis pk the direct influence exerted on a physical system by a subject without any known intermediate energy or instrumentation 1945305 70 michael winkelman current anthropology many supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past present and future complexities and mysteries of the universe cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained views on the supernatural vary for example it may be seen as indistinct from nature from this perspective some events occur according to the laws of nature and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature for example in scholasticism it was believed that god was capable of performing any miracle so long as it didnt lead to a logical contradiction some religions posit immanent deities however and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will occasionalism in the mind neoplatonism or as a part nondualism of a more fundamental divine reality platonism incorrect human attribution in this view all events have natural and only natural causes they believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events such as lightning rainbows floods and the origin of life 71 72
