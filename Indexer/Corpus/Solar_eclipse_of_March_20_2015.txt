the eclipse was observed at radio frequencies at the metshovi radio observatory finland where a partial eclipse was seen 6 the eclipse was also observed by meteorological satellite meteosat-10 7 8 impact edit the european union has a solar power output of about 90 gigawatts and production could have been temporarily decreased by up to 34 gw of that dependent on the clarity of the sky in actuality the dip was less than expected with a 13 gw drop in germany happening due to overcast skies 9 10 this was the first time that an eclipse had a significant impact on the power system and the electricity sector took measures to mitigate the impact the power gradient change in power may be 400 mwminute and 700 mwminute places in netherlands belgium and denmark may be 80 obscured 11 12 temperature may decrease by 3c and wind power may decrease as winds are reduced by 07ms 13 coincidence of events edit in addition to the eclipse 20 march 2015 was also the day of the march equinox also known as the spring or vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere in addition six supermoons were expected for 2015 the supermoon on 20 march 2015 was the third of the year however it was a new
