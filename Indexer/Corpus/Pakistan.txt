islamistan were not shared by other muslim governments 176 although islamists such as the grand mufti of palestine al-haj amin al-husseini and leaders of the muslim brotherhood became drawn to the country pakistans desire for an international organization of muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the organization of islamic conference oic was formed 177 the strongest opposition to the islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the bengali muslims of east pakistan 178 whose educated class according to a survey by social scientist nasim ahmad jawed preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated west pakistanis who tended to prefer an islamic identity 179 the islamist party jamaat-e-islami considered pakistan to be an islamic state and

created certain institutions such as the shariat court and the council of islamic ideology to channel the interpretation and application of islam 182 pakistans leftist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of nizam-e-mustafa rule of the prophet 183 which aimed to establish an islamic state based on sharia laws bhutto agreed to some islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup 184 after taking power from bhutto in a coup detat general zia-ul-haq who came from a religious background 185 committed

bolstered the influence of the ulama islamic clergy and the islamic parties 189 zia-ul-haq forged a strong alliance between the military and deobandi institutions 190 and even though most barelvi ulama 191 and only a few deobandi scholars had supported pakistans creation islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of deobandi and later ahl-e-hadith salafi institutions instead of barelvi
