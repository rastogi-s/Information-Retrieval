kelvin wikipedia kelvin this article is about the unit of temperature for other uses see kelvin disambiguation the kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics the kelvin symbol k is the base unit of temperature in the international system of units si the kelvin is defined as the fraction 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water exactly 001c or 32018f 1 in other words it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 27316k the kelvin scale is named after the belfast-born glasgow university engineer and physicist william thomson 1st baron kelvin 18241907 who wrote of the need for an absolute thermometric scale unlike the degree fahrenheit and degree celsius the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree the kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences but is often used in conjunction with the degree celsius which has the same magnitude the definition implies that absolute zero 0k is equivalent to 27315c 45967f for expressing temperature difference or interval using kelvins instead of degrees celsius helps to avoid situations when people mistake such quantities for celsius temperature 2 the kelvin is the proper temperature unit to be used in derived units like wmk 3 or to have a prefix like milli in mk history edit see also thermodynamic temperature history in 1848 william thomson who later was made lord kelvin wrote in his paper on an absolute thermometric scale of the need for a scale whereby infinite cold absolute zero was the scales null point and which used the degree celsius for its unit increment kelvin calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to 273c on the air thermometers of the time 4 this absolute scale is known today as the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale kelvins value of 273 was the negative reciprocal of 000366the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree celsius relative to the ice point giving a remarkable consistency to the currently accepted value in 1954 resolution 3 of the 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm gave the kelvin scale its modern definition by designating the triple point of water as its second defining point and assigned its temperature to exactly 273.16 kelvins 5 in 19671968 resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm renamed the unit increment of thermodynamic temperature kelvin symbol k replacing degree kelvin symbol k 6 furthermore feeling it useful to more explicitly define the magnitude of the unit increment the 13th cgpm also held in resolution 4 that the kelvin unit of thermodynamic temperature is equal to the fraction 1 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water 1 in 2005 the comit international des poids et mesures cipm a committee of the cgpm affirmed that for the purposes of delineating the temperature of the triple point of water the definition of the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water having an isotopic composition specified as vsmow 7 usage conventions edit when spelled out or spoken the unit is pluralised using the same grammatical rules as for other si units such as the volt or ohm eg the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 kelvins 8 when reference is made to the kelvin scale the word kelvinwhich is normally a nounfunctions adjectivally to modify the noun scale and is capitalized as with most other si unit symbols angle symbols eg 4534 are the exception there is a space between the numeric value and the kelvin symbol eg 99987k 9 10 before the 13th cgpm in 19671968 the unit kelvin was called a degree the same as with the other temperature scales at the time it was distinguished from the other scales with either the adjective suffix kelvin degree kelvin or with absolute degree absolute and its symbol was k the latter term degree absolute which was the units official name from 1948 until 1954 was ambiguous since it could also be interpreted as referring to the rankine scale before the 13th cgpm the plural form was degrees absolute the 13th cgpm changed the unit name to simply kelvin symbol k 11 the omission of degree indicates that it is not relative to an arbitrary reference point like the celsius and fahrenheit scales although the rankine scale continued to use degree rankine but rather an absolute unit of measure which can be manipulated algebraically eg multiplied by two to indicate twice the amount of mean energy available among elementary degrees of freedom of the system use in conjunction with degrees celsius edit in science and engineering degrees celsius and kelvins are often used simultaneously in the same article where absolute temperatures are given in degrees celsius but temperature intervals are given in kelvins eg its measured value was 7002273160280000000 0.010 28 c with an uncertainty of 60k this practice is permissible because the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing relative temperatures and the magnitude of the degree celsius is exactly equal to that of the kelvin 12 notwithstanding that the official endorsement provided by resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm states a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius 6 the practice of simultaneously using both c and k is widespread throughout the scientific world the use of si prefixed forms of the degree celsius such as c or microdegree celsius to express a temperature interval has not been widely adopted proposed redefinition edit main articles proposed redefinition of si base units and codata 2018 in 2005 the cipm embarked on a program to redefine the kelvin along with the other si units using a more experimentally rigorous methodology the current definition as of 2016 update is unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20k and above 7003130000000000000 1300k 13 in particular the committee proposed redefining the kelvin such that boltzmanns constant takes the exact value 6977138065049999999 1.380 6505 10 23 jk 14 the committee had hoped that the program would be completed in time for its adoption by the cgpm at its 2011 meeting but at the 2011 meeting the decision was postponed to the 2014 meeting when it would be considered as part of a larger program 15 the redefinition was further postponed in 2014 pending more accurate measurements of boltzmanns constant in terms of the current definition but it is expected to be adopted at the 26th cgpm in late 2018 16 from a scientific point of view this will link temperature to the rest of si and result in a stable definition that is independent of any particular substance from a practical point of view the redefinition will pass unnoticed water will still freeze at 27315k 000c 3200f 17 practical uses edit colour temperature edit main article colour temperature see also stefanboltzmann constant the kelvin is often used in the measure of the colour temperature of light sources colour temperature is based upon the principle that a black body radiator emits light whose colour depends on the temperature of the radiator black bodies with temperatures below about 7003400000000000000 4000k appear reddish whereas those above about 7003750000000000000 7500k appear bluish colour temperature is important in the fields of image projection and photography where a colour temperature of approximately 7003560000000000000 5600k is required to match daylight film emulsions in astronomy the stellar classification of stars and their place on the hertzsprungrussell diagram are based in part upon their surface temperature known as effective temperature the photosphere of the sun for instance has an effective temperature of 7003577800000000000 5778k digital cameras and photographic software often use colour temperature in k in edit and setup menus the simple guide is that the higher the colour temperature the more white or blue the image will be the reduction in colour temperature will give an image more dominated by reddish warmer colours kelvin as a measure of noise edit main article noise figure in electronics the kelvin is used as an indicator of how noisy a circuit is in relation to an ultimate noise floor ie the noise temperature the so-called johnsonnyquist noise of discrete resistors and capacitors is a type of thermal noise derived from the boltzmann constant and can be used to determine the noise temperature of a circuit using the friis formulas for noise unicode character edit the symbol is encoded in unicode at codepoint u212a kelvin sign however this is a compatibility character provided for compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard recommends using u004b k latin capital letter k instead that is a normal capital k three letterlike symbols have been given canonical equivalence to regular letters u2126 ohm sign u212a kelvin sign and u212b angstrom sign in all three instances the regular letter should be used 18
